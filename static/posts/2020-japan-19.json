{"id":"2020-japan-19","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 20","title":"Kyoto - Imperial Palace, Fushimi Inari Taisha","content":"After making my way back to the train station and heading back into Kyoto, I decided to look around the Imperial Palace grounds, and try to find some lunch in the area.\n\nThe Imperial Palace grounds were nicely kept, and impressively large in every way. Beyond that though, they arenâ€™t overly remarkable, at least during winter.\n\nLunch ended up being at a really nice tonkatsu restaurant. Similar to dinner last night, but this time the pork cutlet was in a sweet soy broth with egg and shallots, making for a fairly different meal, but delicious all the same!\n\nWith lunch done, I made my way to Fushimi Inari Taisha, famous for its many rows of thousands of shrine gates leading around the complex. This place was enormous - the initial area is reasonably large, but the further you travel into the mountains behind the entrance, the more impressive it becomes. So many torii. Just everywhere! There are so many that there are occassionally huge clusters of them setup as their own shrines along the paths! Hiking up many more steps, eventually I reached the main viewing area which gives some pretty impressive views looking out over Kyoto.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this was the place I saw the highest percentage of tourists so far - the place was busy enough, though not too bad, and it was kind of nice to hear some English for a bit haha. Until I heard some whingey girls being overly dramatic about the hike. Then I was happy to leave the area and not be surrounded by as many English speakers again haha.\n\nHaving done many kilometers of walking for the day, with a significant percent of those hiking up and down mountains, I was happy to call it there, and headed back down to the train station and back to the hotel to rest!\n\nLots of walking and hiking, but the scenery was well worth it!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17Fknhtdj7FLaO1B6OCoD1NJtvSBXxsgk?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YH22oZiM1aLnU-LQF7Ckotf16XeVgrbD?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VV21Yzdfs2LYr5_bGF4G8UiRrGcwZIbz?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r1vb9rhSJp6Xzddsx6izyf8USAHcQK-d?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vmbj5S2DOsfnfe59s0wjh5jGJ66Lracp?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bqfoNeUD1HBX4TmEXOxIa3-yxDVeZObD?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11k-jkjdvGuVFql_UPw0cXgVvUmQ2D26J?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hL48iIwTRchIKRzgMrlPgx9aqxjHxQqt?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DkisS6YZPQAR2XfQTLPCS36mErutNDzl?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B98sS6BY6_MuyCdfJqYcOTb-ROKRuU_a?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11StnnkrTsaQtdcHvNBYd3cHH6eWqCpth?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16jKin_B5JJrMwZeMa5s9KV4ZSoHleSv9?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1A9nVEcDOEnuZ-G2lQE4Fi34iqC0tDzrq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ve0FJOGyrFrhiqrHfMG7JL4vCs6-qOHC?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yaODBuFWtFycXjOypf6QUBrhDa2ffjOE?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/151uZ1meABJVrhGr07MVs725LH5ZksxJj?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hkoIV_lbInepGSKIQp6znN1eaSrD8fnm?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BmhWt3358EvCd_qu2FKjcgT2hoo0r8La?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MdAGSCnWajy3Goym2AcVCLNJNenH9nCH?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-qBp2DSk0dthzQYXlMg6t81zWINkCo7W?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IR9pv1ppp3MSPC8AKc0UE7V1D96MnpUE?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hyQOeqoQXdh1DYgzEBsHl3JWLZyAJNYx?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Hh2aOM1JqM_YrVsG8GME-9DLp3tuoMnv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dLu2kcGAJ0Cg0qQo93eyZRsafn0fcoLh?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SYG02QtAM8t-lUuttdhjoUZM2-DGWeFY?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1V9ThqVhoekHy9FkRUr0SobkfgKiwJf5A?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lh7MoYI1umI13q7LYMh5MrQyIhU-9s7N?authuser=0"}]}
