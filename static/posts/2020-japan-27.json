I had forgotten how impressive the castle and grounds are! The whole area is quite large, with winding pathways intended to funnel attackers through a path to make defense easier. Then there is the main keep - so many floors, with narrow and steep stairs between them, especially as you get to the last few. It really was staggering to see again, and to think it was originally built centuries ago.\n\nOnce I had finished exploring the castle, I continued on to Osaka. The accommodation for the night was comfortable, though nothing particularly fancy really.\n\nIn the evening I went to check out Dotonbori, a famous shopping / restaurant street, and grabbed some Osaka style okonomiyaki for dinner. I think I preferred this type - it held together a bit better which made for easier eating.\n\nTo finish the night off, I visited the Space Station bar and had a good time enjoying a couple game themed drinks and chatting to various people who were there. It was a fun way to spend some time and have some conversations for a change!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1K0eI_75VQuMP1O4O1NO0ak5UPfmqqdq_?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/108Ib0D5GN0HDc0zbM6SkVN1kHEAnL6YN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11gwsf95TIgXR2CmS2Bu3FFNhw76-__Ov?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hIz4Jn9ykhYr7uBsSjEHe7FzbQnXmSe4?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10c50E-lkDoGp9_0oWPh6cVB0lKH5_X6R?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-hwcLmfUx4lT4Sd0CIL603LtAamlSwXN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15oabksmdmjf9irsw7fStma0PC7nqvssL?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bAnCWLpUyxxFObiHGbhE3aeWEo5sGIYu?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DA8L2lYhB-QUVbNjz8y924xm_tldRAnW?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IxwoPKelTvkpyQ0gcSOaiYaXwPCph8Zg?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Z0d36k8wHrFHG7V033QI1tDa-MGNpD-R?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15vIWCM1YLTT2YA5CnWfjzLivdFNRc132?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dwh7jhiHoT9plJjSMuKftp56IpwhYphL?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kSSvmmPjDn6pIBEYMkpyozbSHcJiIlNd?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Du8kI8RUcPTbgvyhOKtyUggGrhJmhBsU?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13ScStKZssx7ntRyYgH3qCZkPc2-p_v_M?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LOzdo5vpM9K3SwdvryQfhtprogG-IBoP?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1svavY1ogAN6Rscdy0Ef7yHiW6U-r6Z_B?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BBNHrBTYvafzAZmJB0j7OTS_uKGt-uPA?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JvvaK21DJnJIGUp8IYgWXZv5yI2yeO-C?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OWQDk3kS3HhJ92hwxt4w7BvVm1DLmxzB?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a027AF-rAnf0IQMDYglIVTFTQNOwaS61?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f8TpJGQm3hMFEAXfqK_IBisVwwwRtqWI?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14rDx_xFTwUm5NFME-sPzP9sCdW1uTC7i?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aqAbYjVPETGeZNRh0UY3ELVPtwcJzMKc?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Lx7aDlzzJ9aeM1ZGJokIFpLHRV4nh5_o?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DDxyUKVpu8muSwFEQC6g6jzn7rl6dfag?authuser=0"}]}
