The experience was a novelty, but the tea was very nice and made for a different way to spend time at a stop along the way. The rest stop itself was modern and full of all kinds of things to see and buy.\n\nNext was a short steam train trip through some countryside. The steam train was neat, as were the preserved carriages we rode in. Seeing quite countryside with tea farms and small townships was a great change of pace we all enjoyed.\n\nFrom there we were bussed off to another railway - this one for transport up into the mountains. The carriages were quite narrow and had wooden bench seats lining both sides with not much else to them. This was a unique experience in itself which took us through some lovely mountain landscapes. About half way through the journey we stopped while the train was quickly adjusted for the other unique aspect of the trip - it uses an alternate system to be able to climb steeper inclines up the mountain route. This resulted in a more bumpy ride, but was definitely interesting to experience!\n\nWe transferred to the bus, and for one final experience for the day, we stopped at an observation spot perched up one of the mountains overlooking a lake and part of the railway we had just travelled - the view from here was spectacular, and seeing the train make its way back was a really great way to round out the day's experiences.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AbUg27y_ZggnSMit40S_dtf3NMBokPQ3?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lCa-AKisImThdjRPfTTCi1LKHzUW1j_G?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iC5faT3ohv-PaoCS9w64YZZO92ZeOCKj?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eCdRjizjry2qGR3V2fw7wdf95whHz3WH?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aY1kh2o1v1W0LK8t40bv84ZpTTgS6Xfh?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Jjq31nh4-4ywrmF_CF1nDikLQ86AFCDk?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iS2iO0-VBXfgg6eK-_AXSHZbZkb9QrTA?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ce33EWggjOQ2jhftjuZtpPUf78GndQHX?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L18uaAtBBt6iQm30cP554oqtiBVdmk73?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wb7QRKQa2F05XL3oU2p9zES29plWmYmw?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yBhkZbPQT5Fad4iX10xorw54Yg1ns8PU?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sET7NWl6GNetGUtV6DJCiIIbF9XH0Hyv?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LAi_2RSk3bSW78P6dxOsMhJSVhCzctHf?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n_cTQ-hE7czH2uQkpkvJkm_-QTaMvuGr?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1v6F0VVx58B2QGqQ9ziiOtkt3Zg_rgNj-?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16p27O_16aUiw5FQeGhK9Gc4-6W0BweBl?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dBhm1WOH0ylhQCysb_DjfPS5Tgb8wAur?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LnqHHEU2OCOiQWAPm8hqYThWuH9t_2Ib?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pbfdglcj4rxnLRVaYUmTskZbeQyg718R?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1klbbaew_HVZTfKwHL6z0xf2uU6nZtUTL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZMCF3S_dqd0mOBlEiKZwGplmZN7PrpP0?authuser=0"}]}
