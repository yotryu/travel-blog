We had a camera charge fail, so we left a bit later than we had hoped, but that didn’t stop us from enjoying all that DisneySea park had to offer. We managed to get on to 5 rides in the end - Storm Rider, Raging Spirits, Sinbad’s Storybook Voyage, Journey to the Centre of the Earth, and Tower of Terror (in that order). We waited way too long for Raging Spirits, but the rest of the rides were worth the queues for the experiences - all very unique and fun in their own way.We also caught the Fantasmic! show at 8pm - this was cool to see; loud music, a bit of a story, and plenty of Disney characters and themes.\n\nOne of the more impressive and unexpected things about DisneySea was the layout of the park itself - all the sections transition from one to the next really well, and the attention to detail in the individual attractions and their surrounds was incredible. Everything had a place and added to the experience. As an example, the entire queue for Journey to the Centre of the Earth was inside a cave with props and things relating to the ride. Was all very cool to see.\nAlso, stacks of people lining up to shop in specialty stores inside the park, and all ages lining up to get their picture taken with any number of Disney mascots - the Japanese love their Disney ;)\n\nWas a full day, but well worth the running around from ride to ride. Definitely need to sleep now though haha.\n\nFor more photos, see part 2!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YclTj7CcYpx0e4zvwDH1YEBrS-MZJiZT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KKYNTICclQY2V5gmNwVEcIaNpb8ryClC?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vOqpIdzsPbrP6aOhI3CKma6aYeOBwVWJ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1V0lHSa_TqZPsvIDK3wfGOr8RU4GJGw8p?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lDGwtmzFqVeztlNE2Z2rhQzo_17lWSLW?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n3P_z1gqhwbCANhGF0P2SrYRnVHk2GIi?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1apxBw3hsFg4GuR0EPlu3UYV73LcBNiMa?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a72BrBeLthNJwec74IO9oxOloCIJM2wt?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13c-ebfem_RUoFPfLs5eaYjmTQwqAA1Vn?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JqW2Pzx7iNvfeeJd2QdHPcBlFeqrTftM?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15nSYiYh9fNdtdSDkl0C9CIVGjgKqRg9A?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1h94Q5-1Fktu4HLQ0lzoTdQRun67XyeLN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HnxwUafp34ZqTtXmX7mmdo6fW_qt39m9?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sIbzpqpfvDafyGgKv0Zjz0oZPnvxl4mw?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OB4MKAx8o1CGKfAir2M4VmJpkucOipZ5?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SgIn0bRDk2kFMjUXQoTKwBvWWbknFSMy?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JXyoNNwtZL7ouktHn1u5TPh0WdKxzuRJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Uesa0xnogM-DgaaEpMc9_y63Y4ODggbu?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sMqIwacvv2PnXe7hnWFlb9lRqdhpVOPz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iICeOQ0PujR_4Ns_a_KLRWwU7TR8iYRX?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19Z_7moTPz1bSi0vN8wD7mGxsUeBvpP-e?authuser=0"}]}
