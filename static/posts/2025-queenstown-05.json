    "content": "After the big day on the mountain yesterday, today was another leisurely start.\nOnce we got going, our first stop was yet another coffee shop! This one was in a very nice food court area just off the main street - heaps of natural light coming in, and very open and inviting feeling restaurants. This was yet another excellent coffee as well!\nWith this formality out of the way, we headed for the Skyline gondola entry to head up to the observation and luge area. Our whole group were able to fit in one gondola (just), so we enjoyed the ride up together. First order of business then was to check out the views from the observation balcony - we had a perfect day, so this was fantastic! The mountains, lake, valleys, and town make for a really beautiful landscape.\nNext up was the luge - unfortunately there was a lot of construction going on, so the walk to the luge chairlift wasn't the best, but soon enough we were there and ready to go. One of the kids took a little more coaxing to be able to ride the chairlift, but with some encouragement and half of us going on ahead to show it was fine, they quickly came around.\nMost of the group hadn't done a luge like this before, so it was a new and very fun experience! The views on the side of the mountain looking down over the town and lake are amazing, and when combined with some light adrenaline fun of luging (and a little racing), this made for a spectaluar day!\nWe had 3 runs before lunch, then ordered some delicious food from the cafe, then had our last 3 runs after. By the time we were finished, the kids didn't want it to end, and we all laughed and reminisced about how it all went. Is really such a lot of fun, and I happily do it every time I visit Queenstown now.\nWith that, we headed back down the gondola, but the day wasn't over yet! Next we stopped in a relatively new bowling alley and arcade. Half of the group had a game of 10-pin (accompanied by some tasty beverages) and then half an hour of gaming in the pretty decent arcade. By this time the kids were worn out, so a couple of us grabbed some street food near the lake for dinner before wrapping up a really fantastic day.",
