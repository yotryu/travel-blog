{"id":"2013-usa-canada-04","collection":"2013-usa-canada","date":"2013 January 24","title":"LA + Hollywood","content":"Ended up getting a private car from Anaheim to Downtown LA (where the hotel is), then had the driver take us around to see the usual sights in LA - Beverly Hills (including mandatory massive and expensive houses, then past 1 street, houses with metal bars on windows because the standard of living is much worse), Sunset Dr, Hollywood Blvd, Rodeo Dr and the Hollywood sign.\nRodeo Dr is full of crazy expensive name brand shops - also saw a Bugatti Veyron that apparently belonged to one of the huge names (was parked outside his shop).\nThe biggest take home from LA and Hollywood is that itâ€™s pretty crap. There are select areas where things are nice (namely where we visited and stayed), but everything else was shady and dodgy.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18apKxQYWGJwEr3uMfuc8jfGr2RwObZQK?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bfH8DA7l4VCiJvWPu5B91Qgzxu8_Ch0u?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cUJvOKnM-9LZMK-08lFZoH_yNK2IzHyG?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1frjq2oy5vkBwMU7CjUPOkixzwIZIkyFS?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nwMKtvXu-T7ERZ61-VQNyBcs3xNCciqq?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1giUPEZ2fYY9rKc07b-9yOYiRw7sU_IdQ?authuser=0"}]}
