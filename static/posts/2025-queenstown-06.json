    "content": "Since we didn't have a hire car on this trip, we were all catching the bus to Arrowtown today.\nThankfully the bus network around Queenstown is fairly simple, so this was a relatively easy way to get out there. The journey took us through a valley with some more fantastic views of landscape - I really do like seeing the more rugged, different environment.\nAbout half an hour later we arrived, and just in time for coffee! Today was at Patagonia again (different store though), as it was close to the bus stop, so we could get it quickly before half the group were continuing on to a local winery, and the rest of us explored Arrowtown.\nThe town itself is very quaint - only 2 streets of shops, but plenty of impressive views where ever you look. We wandered through the main street for a while, did a little shopping, and just enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere of the place. I ventured down to the creek just off the main streets and saw some people panning for gold (the main historical claim for the town) in the beautiful surroundings.\nBefore lunch, a couple of us grabbed some 'hot butter spiced rum' to try - this was really unique, and enjoying it while looking out at the winter trees and mountains in the sun was really relaxing! Lunch was a local Thai restaurant in the same area, which turned out to also be an excellent meal.\nWe had a little more time before the bus back, so after a little more browsing the shops, we headed back to Queenstown.\nTonight was minding the kids, so we headed back to the house and had a simple evening of dinner and a couple movies.",
