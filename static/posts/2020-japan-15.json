They were neatly presented with ponds and water flowing, continued up the mountainside to give excellent views over the town and ocean, and had plum blossoms of various colours in a pretty good state of bloom! I hadn’t expected to see any blossoms on the trip (I didn’t realise plum blossoms were a thing and when they bloom), so this was amazing to see! Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed Hasedera!\n\nThe great Buddha at Kotoku-in was the next destination not too far away. After the impressive display at Hasedera, the grounds at Kotoku-in were a little underwhelming, but the giant Buddha was incredible to see. It’s hard to comprehend how such a large structure was made so long ago and continues to stand. Going inside gave a good look at the processes used to make it, which just adds to the impressiveness!\n\nTo finish the day I followed a major hiking path from nearby the giant Buddha back towards the station. This was a decent hike that took me past a few small monuments along the way, but the real highlight was at the end of the hike, just before I reached the roads back to the station. I visited Zeniarai Benten and really enjoyed the atmosphere of relaxation. The entrance was a cave carved out of part of the rock surrounding the shrine complex. Once inside, everything was neat and a bit more compact than normal, which added a “cosy” sort of feel to the place. Plenty of people were visiting as well, many happily sitting on seats in the middle of the complex, chatting or eating some snacks. The place looked great, was in a very unique location, and had an excellent atmosphere! A great way to round out the day in Kamakura.\n\nFrom there it was an easy walk through a park area to the station, and back to the house.\n\nAfter a slightly early dinner tonight, Tristan and I went to the bath house again, and this was almost as enjoyable as the first time - “almost” because at the end the machine for water and green tea wasn’t working ☹️. Still a great experience again!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LDpdsjBZB2WQw57Ha_jKzkKMMakowHsp?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Hb-Icq1byu_egT0SYBJulpdmvuK0P3Rc?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QhhYuaKO-s78ApAFUIomI5AfXu6KIZqC?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SMWuF_wn0h-E8vASo0oDChWVOMG1ROmz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13R7ZAr2Kr6FUUaUCRQFcut7H3buKWyQ0?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dy8zybA-YQNR_anWqLrYrKQXQ4aJvlr2?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QyN_rT1DM68RKXrhRBhfrxAqmqQmJeWe?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iUwug6Tzu5SWbsI7Q-P85TRGSCHFGvW6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zmoGPrIBI1pc6OLjJ2UoU_eA-qL0aDAi?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ciCUPSuI4i1V4KZKDwsQ3iqyTO1jQF9X?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hLWuyxcD6TXP8TIOXSBHGBUp2ysildxF?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17mKBf6lVfnia9i1hokJVrkuvBecURe24?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NrOTVQ8sXw_AKUKV7TRzBQc9goyhmu2e?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JXBzQ-t4viB9Ks2gWacFrzePQtYQZClv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B-dlYRelhFMqdhCPdNS8KdZEpFzcEHiA?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GQ_2lMYLyq4vMqtGGdeGRqwWEviv22__?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1skBBgfZFvDL1cC3hWzLmD7jSBJ-HRuMo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xCoxCu7FvlDp7Q5bq07ISvo6yjiO7B-a?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PXeVShbmVQkMebvF6nSAd6_6S4scxs1M?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1H5VwiOhF4tXA2PV6dXvr5415XpUuxWN8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-VIXSuBg8EvXzqgW3gn6PoxatIzDPndO?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hs1mRZij5xNBNFlRvSOhWqNF6wJRwVRT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zno_krWzU6AyvMrckswUhIbB3hhsWenQ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZyiD0KnB8JuRdcja44hDHL6GbBUE9ty8?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iXoCtVBKmpuGg2Gpyq7dMx16GM-2cQAO?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xque3i-amxbujBfzKF1qq0RMqWTZKrvL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14ok71Btv9mzRA5P0_AcbxOepz5u1GWp8?authuser=0"}]}
