It made for a unique feel to the area, but the main attraction was the canal area, lined with weeping trees and small shops in traditional style buildings. While the canal area was a bit smaller than I had expected, and only a couple of the trees had started to show leaves, it was still a nice place to see. I can imagine how nice it would be to grab a meal or drink in one of the small shops, and enjoy the atmosphere during spring with the trees full of colour!\n\nAfter another train ride I was in Onomichi. On the walk to the hotel I passed a restaurant that looked good for dinner, and the bike rental place, so I would be ready for getting into things quickly tomorrow morning!\n\nThe rest of the day was spent relaxing before having a bit of an earlier night in the hopes that I would be well rested for the long day ahead!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Dd3YIPUEFc0rPWCgb665KaY5Ov2_YhMb?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1d7ggofKcb_LpHxglrC6n67EnnjGaw4NG?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MQTC5hl7qxCbsNpwwbTpip7yrfnuRVQG?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bFJK-cL6hoMsUkLU3R2gaTAYuM2ei-8G?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yw42-etrpIsoBUpsAWVt7ieHzgP6UTZ-?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kK__enshBz8Lr2IGLjCFz-ci9a_SLljE?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fGe0cw3_WsvYKhIauYNAnGfkHP5JQ4vi?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BNcaXRmKTPZzdpL3FHuV2K8bphmBhXGj?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BUWQOIbRW6_1NiCRCIuQahvxufk2J_Zh?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18kaTCXvmF-k_EYJqHL4DCarB8jjJd1_d?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SN_hpBc-eNlibMbvKB7o7_hEg8AdCLj8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dbJLzKIFmbjO-wW_0Ayx82WO4Vx8wgmG?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1irxDpYMTswbdS2q0CThzjwQMThOYar1Y?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1W-ZPFDwmnH8wKcXwHi1GBvM3JrXugrQ3?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RvVxB6LPOGlaoWdLlCDQGYc9vos2NnwA?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QCqElzb3gDfwu_kdo1KCiyf5WisjYWe_?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1frd4g1wqDbUZDd1Lf_Ax76I8ZM08bB4R?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BJcqr0jGL8Vl8g9ocG8wOO_h4ekjibXR?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ELQc7RGXES56Deks5PmCxecNku5BL_7D?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dADpGZSca3ikei43Kg1YmCINwkqgEgd9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15RHVfM7SOoZFaSV9FdctXayWdUw4qThz?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lA5GAqezv85h3OwfIslS2VAkS1rc_3-R?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/110fO2JdfqJ1HH2EcTOPM1NcOLw4H5PMv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LIm-b2r3-usK8Dt6YSxGhuB1Y7g91LrH?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CLD2ktE4ptE3_LVEqK1-ps0TRrAx-cz_?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Z0iwkGLTFUq9Cba8sTf79BsPBvYOhMa6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Uo8ynyhUr0Av9x6mGsKh3ZT9D9IgbRi5?authuser=0"}]}
