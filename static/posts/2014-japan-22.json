Unfortunately visibility was poor today, and the snow at Goryu was fairly icy, and there were far too many people there! Once we got below the clouds at Hakuba 47 it wasn’t too bad, but for a last day we decided to call it a bit early and get ourselves ready to leave the next morning.\n\nThe highlight today though was the trip to an onsen (Mominoki Hotel) - this really was an experience worth doing. The water is unbelievably warm considering the outside temperature (below 0˚C) and you do feel relaxed and clean afterwards! The whole experience includes showering beforehand and bathing naked, so no photos are allowed.\n\nThe onsen was definitely the right way to spend our last afternoon in Hakuba - rounded out the trip very nicely.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sWtYNXvGAQfeyS2EhKQoiSMp8cVgfzqH?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ofes7-Wm6FH6Sg2MpDrQSxRa24Eh20Cs?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mvnhdi5Eybb57xdO-bzjfq2SnqXDPLuh?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qj_ozF3I8TSjo4SokhWWvt8tbDIxPjEt?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zaj_wpPP6YAAt_w9xYiPUewWk76gLmpK?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11o9OizS8cEEbsWtWmsScTqduhQiiztN6?authuser=0"}]}
