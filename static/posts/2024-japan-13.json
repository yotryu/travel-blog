Our guide explained many students go there to pray for success in their academic endeavours. \n\nThe grounds were quite expansive, with a great combination of shrine structures and nature - ponds, unique bridges, and forest with some really impressive trees. I really liked the variety of trees and how the shrine felt like it was made to co-exist with the environment.\n\nAfter exploring the shrine, we had time to check out the shops in the street leading up to it. We picked up some souvenirs, and enjoyed a coffee, gelato, and chat with some others in our tour group.\n\nFor the afternoon, we went to a large-ish shopping mall in the city. There was a pretty solid looking tempura restaurant, so we decided to give it a go since we hadn't tried it yet. Sat at the bar, the food we ordered from the vending machine outside was brought over as it was ready. Everything tasted excellent! The experience was great, and everyone enjoyed the food, as well as seeing the process of it being made for us.\n\nAs we got closer to the evening, it was time to be taken to the ferry terminal where we would sleep overnight and find ourselves in Osaka the next morning!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jFScViDtRf0zHF52AkMWVVbrZrKRSlog?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m1qiuYzUEwMAq31AX7BUPrdGxZ1wtm9U?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IRtqi1CrM6hdEVHWXe1zE1Eyd7ZGtWiB?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1D_ZZo7rvBKjZJArvzASimfn1hLVgm3Eo?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/107SxnOd6BuODM1aurHkPyOzM4l7Bv_1e?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DH2AJhsMaYfhC3tRGLtLWCRDvEXZAU_z?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wUcVmkhdDHx7ZV4D4gAij7PCDus-iLW1?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wCdlGd6ne8B7if-ytZEBBT1HUo0xQX1m?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aB0_DvH2BshZnBnXnNnX9spHkqWIGS33?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i9kgQp_8mtlHKETP90kPrd4UBNikG5cC?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OaYUDdMpsxhOvy8bzW34K2FGHzJV_AZO?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rsq1hbB1Dyi8OHc0Rsh_MzdJYB5dzqAy?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UD9OlZnwJIhGIL6lfhAZjWQuamyT68ME?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cavtr9-qhwlZzEvNuKnONu0WeBhEl5tS?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sdDBr7rk0mXHiZqdoY5C6RelQlo1JM7D?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aqRNn0HOMdPJ0v24R7cq-TG2157PRIY8?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OyctuhKVSmfGVYuVB2vMy99-L70h6v57?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_skfi7SS_iAQdbHCBZRcsW-jHcfcr8kN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f0kJ5cC7sVh9zmh5PaXDAmtTOw2YTyj2?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1s2o62aKVQZeBgBUQZWpjnSUyCBX1aLt6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NzRHSmwdFP-rqKxYYIeiMLYHfSw4lbPh?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vqTtE9tyqQZ0kadnvkfXa9cfPa5syZfT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZTPNzxobRm6t76_IG2ydp0gDcgt8MK5d?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-l9Odz3WeZ94iNbB2YrQn4Q6ISxH6UAc?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yaM6C_qCZZa3Ue63PiBnPHHAHOLBAtaC?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r20ccYSgdSVzR0C3sRgT-J0Cy7MIyAH3?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hL3fQnCOmTo2jNEtEJGxh9PghEuWh8Ob?authuser=0"}]}
