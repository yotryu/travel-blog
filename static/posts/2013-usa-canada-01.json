Flight was fine, bit bumpy but only minor, however knees were not liking the angles and length of time (despite semi-frequent walks / stretches) haha. Sorted the phones out easily and just hanging out near maccas getting on top of internet tasks before we head to the hotel (also tired so kind of recovering a bit haha).\n\nGot to Anaheim about 12:30pm local time, dropped at the hotel - couldn’t check in but could leave luggage so did that and went walking around the Disneyland Resort area for 2 hours haha. Found some places to eat and how to get to Disneyland easily. Bellhop had plenty to tell us about the area and getting to LA from here. Finally got in to our room near 4pm, cleaned up and feeling better for dinner and maybe checking out the fireworks at Disneyland (is a public holiday here today)… assuming we can stay awake haha.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1M2HRBTJQgdQKo_9MAKhYFtM1VR0QxVif?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1subhwPQgZ6fKXFRSLjnZapKMic20ci-u?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CcT4na_QDPXX6UyB2SS7tIZfPUExMBVI?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BMZquMFxqkIF-LzgnAnhV9967B1jxWgL?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AEB6QnOlD97Zrv6JqB5z6qa6-w1tFWvY?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jdUOItphnNe_LjDSzI28HBHwX6YlzlMe?authuser=0"}]}
