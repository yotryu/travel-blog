{"id":"2024-japan-08","collection":"2024-japan","date":"2024 December 2","title":"Kyoto - Monkey Park + Kinkakuji","content":"After lunch we made our way to the bottom of the trek to the monkey park, unsure of if we would make it up before we had to get back to the bus.\n\nThe first section is the steepest, but as a result we weren't sure if we could all make it, so I went on ahead just in case. I made it up with maybe 15 minutes to spare. The views of the city are hard to beat from here, and hanging out watching the monkeys do their thing, being removed from the hustle of the city, it still is a very nice place to visit.\n\nThankfully the others made it up with 5-10 minutes to take it in, so we got some quick photos and turned around to make sure we made it back to the bus in time.\n\nBack on the bus, our final stop for the day was Kinkakuji - the famous \"Golden Pavilion\". \n\nIt was probably planned this way with the tour, but our arrival time put us in the grounds during \"golden hour\", and it absolutely lived up to the name in every possible way. Seeing the main building in the afternoon light on a perfect day was definitely all it's cracked up to be. The colours, the reflection in the water, the overall vibe of the place... Taking it all in (thankfully we had plenty of time here to not rush) - even though it was a little busy - was no doubt an exceptional way to wrap up what was an absolutely spectacular day.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12mMhXq5KzHUpG7f4oUk6jrbVMB7LI7VX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bnHGvfQSc2zztgfY_Fl3PFLOiNlUc5m7?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DV4QidCYtmYoouQfErNBiF96ylgqDZqK?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ShufgxpQ2duiwPXx4Q15tsHUeFe_CeC3?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16CsHgLVNTEfz5kzv4L-ckrsxDrWRZK29?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tqpjsJmMrlC41bEzQHDQy_pJYo02uGez?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YHCpLv6YOdjON-WMDQAg_Iw8xL55x573?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15t2q0YQA3dlJKEhXsttMauOLdfPJHioZ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1N9gJLQbtOsKUzenGFJlvJ40oGj4zooMm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XPXqwzJXXJWaQGZwjn___95fb97QNkIh?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xQy3ixOQJaEaf8ddyOsKUWFJdWZOQCop?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-ZL1fgOVyxlbOCHNxVjnYpvgXDgw9K3S?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1k_pk73bwsOBwBncLAyo2bvAmRyqQoaoJ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1puouvZyd9e5lRofiPrfhhMJwkUj5CHxR?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ekLBpBsRXagJwVf1qxSCZ5p9rIsNE8KQ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tTU969-V2KEa6ijEee91PRVHOx9G-aK8?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pifk0zGpB0Kpww3IQ0ohEVpGfDzEIZY5?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i6UHMy9-__ZCE48InJB8lMxUWMLG5R50?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12YS8pi8bnr4KFjiCWRTvPhkcxAzkMSIq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1l1-elSDUw1yQ0ez6lZ4482PvC4SI4w1d?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1om_ZncqYfAEMjKkVTDazU-OMJ0wv1Ggj?authuser=0"}]}
