While we were there we finally had curry, and it tasted great!\n\nAfter that we had planned to meet Tristan and Naoko, so we went to Ikebukuro. All of us went to a cat cafe (not really a cafe, but a place to hang out with cats, pat them and take photos) - a unique experience that you wouldn’t find in Australia! All the cats were very friendly, though a bit tired from the busy day.\nDinner was katsudon at a small place in Ikebukuro. It was fun trying something different (ordering from a vending machine that gives a ticket to pass to the counter), though the food wasn’t as good as some other meals we’ve had in the past week.\n\nFinally was bowling! Four floors of 10 lanes of bowling each - this place was heaps of fun! The 5 of us played a couple games, had some laughs and tried on the bowling pin costume. Big thanks to Tristan and Naoko for joining us to have some fun (also Naoko was a huge help getting things happening at all!).\nThis was our last full day in Tokyo, tomorrow we’re off to Kyoto!\n\nAlso, Trent had a skill tester fail - the prize got stuck by its tag, producing the face in the picture. All good though - the attendant opened the machine and gave him the prize with no fuss :)","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t51KPc9Nd9lfNZCfwJZpytOddDhweEbH?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qgBWEnZuFd8Ql8mLhr8_svh3CBG2sMVe?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ddiXs-JYXc9J3zmlOsVvVD6-lOQd8CIm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NDmHK8uJA-WTc3sGtXB_0Ykl8ZWUIGw5?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ng2PejTCYyhgWoEJDpSxUVwuSbvUxBUL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1as1U-TAweqwbkWid4UjhYwTcpMrles6B?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XL0TpT3_q_64FUYn8IhN0Kpj8wjUzoW6?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZZqP7z2kck1x0uqi8iVKX5hQC7NAgNFv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KH2qMLLupaXwVtEnyi3RhV1wHGv55xR5?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tb4yHNsguRYBQv-UJzJdmUyJHo6khzrF?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1leQ7gU_uZQ4X-9S5uz6frOzaFsego3dB?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PqXbH0ZeNsnEuww5YpJ3_Sc4RGoE_ZEg?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SNduBS4djkfRs2NBY0rWmxLrCQL7o_aE?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OmXMCeQirQrGfkx7ddvEAbKNGZ_dHmJk?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1o1C1calEdA7-0zCPuF9gZrSr72Ywlhw0?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wp_byBDBtNW2ItKIBwPx9K3HcaY3BQhR?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1E3DsuOvmi7nanFSw2OQI7h98ndoJ0nZ6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14_VYByqWTilzT0vRLJgHMtv9kNDYJYsh?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mXa6HjlYRIk-lMz4LQb6NbWvV5r1qu56?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dHFX2td8woT6CzbiO1pOPA8qWdatPSJh?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14EZ-RNTw1B8_zTeXQV9m4TJwWCumbuG-?authuser=0"}]}
