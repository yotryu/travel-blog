Pretty much all of this was new to all of us, so we had a bit of fun getting used to the slightly different trains (just different lines, not quite as clear what’s happening). First stop was Universal Studios Japan.\n\nManaged to get on pretty much all the main rides we were interested while we were here for about 5 hours, so we were all pretty pleased about that. Jaws, Spiderman, Back to the Future, Backdraft, Terminator 2 3D, and Space Fantasy in that order! All the rides were great in their own way, but finishing with Space Fantasy was a huge surprise - such a fun mini rollercoaster that was really simple but had great interesting effects and rotating seats; and we were the last people in the queue before closing (probably because we stood at the entry gate looking confused about whether it was open or not still, so they let us in!). Went straight to Hard Rock Cafe just outside the entrance to Universal Studios for dinner - Trent is a big fan of trying out all the different ones around the world, but it was great food :)\n\nIn the evening we went into Osaka, and that’s in part 2!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zpJN5medODd5gErnOt6fffNuA-AyVFNz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TFx6lPkH_pxF2vuswSASXZOTr4p2jt5n?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13aY4txTYcuTb_oQ9nPlMXn-J3LdwVIWF?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XKOTjMsmNxAKRsiJfleUfzFB4pHa1Hv5?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iILDB0g8tHjjVKPgqVvzdUZNF6M6vEgc?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14-xZ6nxnrSyqpwr5Eo-EO6zFBz-8W6wS?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15njK8hG175mHn4rAiYGGS2cqQidO8u9k?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JDlALA6zEvVYc3mpARPBTYlLySkLj3l3?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sl03jsVQNh0sU2NosivCuGbLxKO0H9vt?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11WGFruJ0tWaF8gQLS5FIk3kPKkoibWGZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ie9tURom7nIaRtW5rXQq1C_Iew_UlN7l?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10qiBDncb9xeJ0ETxcgOqpCEQGdKFHjMX?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m9FKLkX0znmV6-GmTLGgnSTnvgM9NoLP?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GukivIqnPkprjMuEHAH6AFpKraixAL_g?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SeI6oVdBcrXgNWzcU5FpN_XFBC0WnJOK?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R1xnYcuQjniyE23DTB278AFVheWfWbCP?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uIUNeO888tP9n3vqVOstEtdmMvdu6Abi?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F3gGvpZUXKm46zB6ie72o7dR5effnjMH?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qqTKIFFgP1NeXjFMNaXwnjwVZkB0u0A1?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14LW7j30n6ZGyKYtobUufT7C5EaqdlIau?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13NVWqNqVd5pl17v7WN2qJExssJKZp4_k?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bQFhmnZACsW6QB3Svfv4JJOW-mRTF7kp?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19JUpe1G7wQVSmJzFJOYpQ-3umAJFh7WL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Np7H5yeC6dTH6iCWlJGkfqNgzd1Lzzxy?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VM2JJdeNpT92jr-VtTW9s5FA_gL4xzZx?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AJ-SeL92jETwp955qDzuAa01haDLhdk4?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ER6f-2lKwhuA2o6DY0V76taJsSiuV43C?authuser=0"}]}
