Fallen petals in the water, colours all over the trees, and the weather was perfect, so the view back over the city and water eas great. Though it is a paid entry temple, I think it's well worth it for how unique it is.\n\nFinally after all that walking I was happy to try riding the Enoshima electric railway back to the main train station. This was a great little trip, threaded behind shops and houses, providing a unique perspective of the area. People live so close to the train tracks! The stations and train cars themselves are also a bit old-fashioned which is a nice novel experience too.\n\nFinally, I spent the evening with Tristan and his family one more time before it would be leaving.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10KMpbLURRUh6b4p227PPRwGCxnGQSU38?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/163AXiLWGe9hJS7hncXdzSbOeCqTHMaoG?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pb1GNhykYeI2MLBC8wEsndziqct2BDTT?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rm3oGXwT3QlWDKwkiuAQrPK6_ebF_rYx?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KRmgvWm7dUFi41RO91_IIy2w8u2MTlQC?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PQ9SjPweWSi0VdYDMxD99wLC_vVkPa1i?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iBdeAfy3cM-MoKnUqTOZhGyKB24XlyB5?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/134Ny5VEF3DoQPWFm_eY7AttQzHoPNf33?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Q3zinRGQnI54T_cOGeKxJEEmal0qxLUE?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/149WFBSGP4nqIBHBwXGkY3xpLmtDscMBA?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1znBW1394KMjqe4A83q6fcA3EtfkyqdMF?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ANjTsSTAcHtRYVlBKNJIwsrnszb4cbG1?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-9hZe5TpXUlhpO4XRgLvUWazbMHIzZBK?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xli_NFJ_m4bClxH75NVDaEhhheKJglg2?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yjMRlhmo7_wZIoehBgRvOHZv5Bcdp2Wa?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BCayIi5-gw4vs6p0ojpMi5nyCNZa_h0M?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sp6-SzGhY3imK8-pCrX9sO33lCcZRPTC?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CkhqmsV0nK7qD2nwmbFn0Nc6rRoWWuLo?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xlW25f3rwny5sOagyRsS_BpexqGwPdVZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pAk7MSiavxaYsXDZwDwrWq9NM4VmLKRi?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ec8kGpv4tjsbNqAVhECEsMxUPP5WIN6-?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1V500JEQDLBToQt19c16hkiVtQWpQM5WP?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CWHhctDCWFld9MeOtOKXhQIynaCKr4CQ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ULoeXoS2SqxfP9vwzPI0k4odehe6bhnQ?authuser=0"}]}
