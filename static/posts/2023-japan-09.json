{"id":"2023-japan-09","collection":"2023-japan","date":"2023 February 18- - 20","title":"Hakuba - Snowboarding","content":"Tristan arrived in the night and we had a full day at Happo-one together.\n\nThis was a lot of fun - having a friend to join in the boarding was great and something I had missed on my previous days. Lots of catching up on the snow and squeezing in as much as we could.\n\nDinner was at a nearby pub which gave Tristan the rare opportunity to have some western style food.\n\nThe next day wasn't the best weather, but we went out not wanting to let Tristan's final day go to waste. Unfortunately the fatigue and poor visibility meant I had a decent stack (no injuries thankfully) which shook my confidence, so I called it early while he got in a few more runs on the lower slopes.\n\nI met him at the bottom of the mountain once he was done, and we went to a nearby hotel onsen and enjoyed that after 2 days of boarding together.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mPlOASwkJXB-Zhn5bBrewc32SwhuZRcZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cahn1gHn08HfXpxD5e5bi5KewyysZqff?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qLvwH2fGT4_0beTFtE4Rog47EgfmER5h?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aVt4RG8ZtsV8YvLZzSJT79BGxED8Ivqq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xU2EnELgUIRasj0yQk7KtqTnH2Pde7-z?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/171Ug1gGco_c1uE8nJUHJ0XhwBvYuHS_j?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1S1q_8yRE3OUloIPLcX6u1Gj2HAjz8hjK?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1P6QhJ6ADhlc35cxEQn035TZq2pn9pM0h?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Xu3mKu4q75sRPGIc-AlNluQ-xHm2LJ7F?authuser=0"}]}
