{"id":"2024-japan-18","collection":"2024-japan","date":"2024 December 10","title":"Postal Towns + Mountains","content":"Today we travelled through the mountains to visit 2 postal towns - towns with preserved areas of buildings and streets used back when the route between Tokyo and Kyoto passed through them. Around every 10km one of these towns marked a place for businesses to thrive, serving travellers passing through, and giving them a place to shelter on their journey.\n\nThese towns were really neat to see, with the historical buildings and streets a stark departure from the modern we have been seeing. It was a bit strange seeing most of the buildings closed and without much in the way of business, but this does make sense - the government provides funding to help the communities preserve the areas, but aside from occasional tours coming through, there isn't much in the way of customers anymore, since the routes aren't travelled much with modern infrastructure providing faster alternatives.\n\nIn between the 2 towns, we stopped at a mountainside rest stop for lunch. This was a relatively small rest stop, but had some amazing local produce for sale, and our lunch was a tiny steamed bun and gyoza shop which made fantastic food. The rest stop was perched on the side of the mountain looking over a valley, and made for a really nice place to enjoy a meal before we continued on.\n\nOur hotel tonight was in Matsumoto city, and seeing as it was the second last night of the tour, our guide suggested a group dinner out at a nearby Irish pub. Most of us went to this, and it was a great time. We had some nice food, some great drinks, and chatted for a while before settling in for the night. It was a great way to start to wrap up the trip.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mcsc3BRE6p7T6tQeil4ocXsM0t1-0-1X?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Iujktoi68tfSVnu9CEdI-wBigxubfedJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11gaztxq0sHTm30_rpqvSCEhhvojWiGCA?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1X1FuR9oWGELdbff_oTpOCP3ULuFa2d5-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14ksboKPYWNw_WVX-QgTaU6kStdIDqD-9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Y9cLEcCmjxU_lGcOrYiyHZaKyTKcrmfH?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1V_8kvt_3ltcNIAtlFExI5rF5bEmEmGrz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rIDay8jTEhNz7kreCxvL_snJiCXSWiJp?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SB8YujQGwPe8KZCmfgSvXSrk4OdNE7U-?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CA5Hpo3conzlFSfpng96FS2Knvd7No4u?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19VgEZ9T0ei-CQ6IPCPmm6Y-ZG5TKDIPu?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12VbfUG1n4MsB1xzqYKXOb-f0YrOMIavU?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B1WP5ehxh2osqlOW9fIY193-iykfvBIa?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nv7KblFQCVlt7hSs0wLdPbJNbNI-vuKD?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1muLepHAvm1ggBSUxFqr2f0Q11xUOr_jj?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MaHRJen6fEQwXQYXtXWzpGeql4YbWWDb?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jRUwXm7usACN8f29Vns3Dv95eV5wrjT1?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15dKxW7pJ8MI8tj1u1rnHYDjd5ZjNuTim?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R_pMeL0-DNtcj6kF4CMCs1ZybEHdSBL0?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LWGq8VLUl9Ime_oWDmvItg_yMK2pyywP?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GxkvEVjlUbDhFwDFS1g8c8LRGo2EVv5t?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VP7Lkhr0NhJIZvGsYR4VhNSRVRx71O9B?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HYW1IpVRjS2uRmRT8IlvPGztTMYZ2y7n?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BxcQZXHKYInhakD5WdXRgAOe1GeZvt-_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zltZS0DAANRKnzA_VHVDXwB_AbjX6Nhn?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11eW1AzfDGncnXiNQ81X5GwfpJNLKjGe9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1paC5nxCiFc8gvwgbW090EWi0G87xnAR4?authuser=0"}]}
