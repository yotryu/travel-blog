The previous one I went to was all about digital artworks and an expansive indoor presentation. This one was more \"interactive\" in the sense that it was mostly no shoes and walking through water as a core component of it. The different experiences mostly focused on water providing a unique sensation as a part of the artwork. Many included interactive elements while walking around, allowing guests to influence what they were experiencing. It really is hard to explain, but it was a very cool place to visit! Definitely one I will always be happy to revisit to see the newest installation whenever I can!\n\nThe second part of the experience was more about \"living art\" - plants and sculptures being used in interesting and more \"immersive\" ways.\n\nFinally I wandered around the shopping area a little, and decided on a snack of nigiri from a place that looked great. This wasn't the cheapest, but it did taste fantastic!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SkQzQVnDEjAmz7TgGfVScuDxpP8g7h-M?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13l-ahm4mlgItqtuOTa76JSsTpfkWBnHf?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fZXipqjVB01i-yFwEzQaJ8emNZ-pQs5i?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UefVD8MGN23A12ZpyFguxHqJn5PeMg60?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lI_RuOWYZidSnWur9pntxHbvTdJlp5pE?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zkXcJvKtzS76-JHilfhgFGfHJSXs4lxo?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FPdC8Z0VUAENQJgewEs6PDW6UBhVKlYY?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OO_PBk8KBg_L6zza3pBx36V3Ief6Q6F6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lQVSv2F6cw2HDw9MSytkNecPqDZBWTmF?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pV3K82VorX_67SeFdbpbskuFcUDmT1xa?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DDk7xtyViCGlV-nSyfdZPGn8-1_Bg5f_?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Wa4woy75q96lRvIwmXwRivHqEuEQHinr?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11TY1CnAfKo2k7-1kbqKJYJYa7Lxk-oYT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1u-8SNsr62WckXad21CuKamK9l4EJvvF5?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1u0kKmVU0jgiBNv5RMDW9PuJQyfFChIAk?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TLs2IC-gNjp3RUWNaHNOOgvJmD2_FRhj?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_Q8onwGtWDbQa6IRBe2n_3KVn8Gm8LMN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15GLNIKAGClOCAJKe94dmgQZZIFmjPEDZ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19r-r__7ZzVs-jV9rDagB6YanmOd_CZ04?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RExY0A1nBEQsvlueFcfiQs21DDFHhuDK?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dgkUdu19L0gIMbP9Q-UGpuirKDym_5Z1?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AQu2aFJpuBYGviqoH7VSGmoOxN3ibsJe?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eWpLzrw27cRMK25ENjTUZVUblQ8bh3TZ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18JvPlRM3Q8uH1vHM6rzNMVilZvHyCPxr?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PkJDb1SHNbrd9z7k2d7osbaJm2RiysXQ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12yZOCjvEKqnIKzot1wB5F1NqyrFAgL_k?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vzIPMoz0yb0CiYam-ENITFe7XboqG384?authuser=0"}]}
