Reasonable crowds, but really not too bad for such a touristy spot (we saw more foreigners here than anywhere else so far). All the grounds and buildings are in immaculate condition, with huge statues and sculptures making this an interesting place to see. People bathe themselves in incense and wash their hands before entering the main hall to pray and receive a fortune. After we got our fortunes and checked the grounds, we did some shopping in the market / mall between the subway station and the temple - so many things for tourists to buy!\n\nLastly we visited the Tokyo Skytree - the world’s tallest tower (there are taller structures, but this is now the tallest tower at 634m) - in the evening. The thing is ridiculously impressive - it doesn’t have a huge base like you’d think, and the views from the observation decks (350m and 450m up) were great (though a bit obscured by some clouds). Was a cool way to get a different look at Tokyo with all its lights going on forever.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15vNpFyzRlKgxXGLmda6O_fO5mFF80Z4I?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KUGHt94J0sBZ5vQsVfQTCF3T-EsBE1LD?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yS8XR0xfDQLbP-X9nlhZVQtkcfEWaFyE?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ccinxFXcntKKq6Ejg5ScTYtJwAuORHlS?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FLJxgM_fWM8m05HZsCtEVgnd857dIpHG?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m-lKXjW2PctklYF19JdZ3Yusdv6e6FUS?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1egA957Ar4gvZcRewDGAWDeSCKU0UY1rf?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KQ5WHKsiA-YMTyKk7lRqT9reULrBW6bK?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ptrtNhI3C4TWDGozqy8_XlUrLwv_qvsm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lGYpMcppqe3u6nMtaxGNXUlHup_NapeX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XKn7qHiTm6Phz5zoka1ziyw05GPmJb42?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1G4nH24n-F1SarQBhPBevlpKv_-eIagCZ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15E53uJfSL-mGfCM9bSIz7Fx206Ldao0A?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16oCXpCBJP4oEzshjjwXo_iAqB0GKNJv_?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AeRyQNYB2XBbzmDSNM6QSIAb7Fo4RYwu?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r8Gy8iHNZ7PyiuCQOewvEy7EDmMNSU6c?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LmFPgwME9K2Mo1LUuVeGOO-56TSl8om1?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AtzNm9kinL3c30CxrKYT2jQQSGY0JDHn?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EH_kYjCPEP1kLSvBkYuB7rDpPXNEBxE8?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14-mXLm_0PHsp6skaAV7-NUfggg2DkFfm?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1M-vjH7_W4gOZdFIl1KpHtUmp1KOEIGIr?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1drafY-F_hpFnnsQnmoRFPtRPaqehZcxW?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EewXjaW0YDbWNMAMEDfL_kR6eswfoArL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nfSjhIF1AB9oMYBLYVRHdZUlH0u6fvYo?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1spkC4-ASpogDyBZb364OH5sK21kIF7Po?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fzei81NEBlk6ZT2zTLIb-xcVedz19vGH?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ySoIg-QdlfO-Lg-XiFsfGlJxIj04d4_4?authuser=0"}]}
