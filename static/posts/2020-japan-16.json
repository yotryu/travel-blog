{"id":"2020-japan-16","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 18","title":"Tokyo â†’ Takayama - Historic District","content":"Another day of fairly long travel! The main 2 trains to Takayama totalled about 4.5 hours, plus there was a little time transferring and getting to the Shinkansen in Tokyo.\n\nThankfully once I arrived I was able to check in to my hotel early and drop my luggage before heading to the historic district and Shiroyama park, which is where the Takayama castle ruins are. Also, it was snowing a little in town for the whole afternoon!\n\nWalking to the historic district I spotted a lot of restaurants advertising beef - I think the Hida region is maybe known for their quality beef? The historic district itself was very neat and interesting - a narrow street lined with old style buildings and drains down below, meaning each shop had a little bridge leading inside. Lots of food and souvenier shops, but they all looked really nice with the traditional facades and styling.\n\nNext was Shiroyama park, which is a sort of walking trail park with a few monuments scattered around, and a couple of areas where foundation / ruins of the old castle can be found. I enjoyed walking through here with the snow everywhere and very few other people around. At one point I reached a monument (which kind of act like guideposts around the trails), stopped to take a photo, and realised it was completely silent. Iâ€™ve only had that experience once before that I can remember (on the side of a mountain when snowboarding in NZ), so I enjoyed that for a moment before continuing. The top of the park / hill gave some decent views of the area through the trees as well.\n\nBack to the hotel, I decided to try and have a hot bath in a private onsen that is on the top floor of the hotel. Luckily I was able to after a 5 or so minute wait, and it was worth it! Not as extravagent as the bath house, but with an excellent view looking over the city and mountains, and the privacy to relax and just soak it in.\n\nDinner was chicken curry, naan, salad, and a drink from a small Indian Nepalese restaurant not too far from the train station. This was fantastically delicious and a great variation from Japaneae food all the time ðŸ˜‰. Not a bad way to wrap up the day!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Sw_92xfInfRygUx2s2I8Ncu8oFffE_mM?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KRUl_5P8HBSjtyYIwdzJrivUo828W1TM?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cnEGMPQgEDRhTOmNiaJ6V8RErjmW6nL2?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AZjaxIyHipxo3DDD2jBbI_B3iGi8_6I5?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZnNA1D2L2kxKYKxpvrvqp-rpMk0JY0dn?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ro0dId0uDFpuzO5-0MC8qsyjOty5XK5h?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/198PoztX-MzaU-1IRkU2Oqv1wdVHc4NWq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kURSvRWADTzgqg3h6qYP_1bDc8Ox9SXB?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15kuBwSWQLIvbNLhfVIFLqd49cHW6fwLR?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1g9vrzsL_hRNWcS8wB41INTc9C0s2ZP8D?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GVaelgF2KQQafyMf-c1gcndsO5331_gy?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1W8fcVq1-tpQ7hJepRQUSv727GptXEbqa?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hOpu8-h8pscRHytNBrXlAVC-yZiJIoiN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16kkM9xwYSh7MhIXPqNCEMfaDP2CjdN9s?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ql3FErfvqVpsAhVJBofwXZucOOFsbGY2?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EeuhErW-gfQXKPFDWHDjCS5bPim3wHzY?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t58oldRgfuqvlGQ2dShx1yv4FKAHy6_X?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RrQr2YGUzYEXPuuDDzAsVix01qzHWuE4?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1P5XR0q1tCp4S_5567yyJ6CtCoA6AxwsG?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BxS8Pp8Jshr62dCAf__RsRr_VjWxaM--?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10_yjSYGyEAztkFN068UlRYcKzHWGJC8Y?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ujyyzYWagXHdmaEPEeNwQwbPRQQJDF7d?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YaJH4hfFEbRgWk6qqJFdonFLsp_JB8m3?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r_XZQUzauNeCnkfkoIlbKoVljn-Y8jLy?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JCPiXBosM-vraIJ1SaogSdFz_VuLSfDW?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sE51WhXh-6O3rdOp5tS_B4ixmU_eOARY?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-Cuzr_hkv-HHhXt5yczlDwPsyOOS_Uao?authuser=0"}]}
