Definitely am getting better each day and having more fun as time goes on :)\n\nJules has managed to get more speed and started doing some jumps - definitely also getting better!\n\nHave also been doing the runs with a couple of guys we worked with from JB - we can basically pair off with skill levels so being able to hang out with them has been awesome!\n\nSnowmobile and dogsledding day tomorrow - will be a good “rest” day from snowboarding getting us ready for one last day before we leave Whistler.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ADt4gCMc29iweX5It2WwAOatBEqYhdrC?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bL7Kyd_YL_nb6nuxVIgDoWSP5-6Qrl4Y?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tHLWy111Cf7fkR4l2KpTB-AudVPjv7Wj?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dCoCPOs_YhLeTS0iSF8eawba57C9epeD?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kggk5vy4NAQ-u9zX3iQ4fVVACH3v_laO?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ch642UZaTPtxwStdknNBciEQBC-Hy057?authuser=0"}]}
