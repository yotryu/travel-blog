He was impressed I managed to make it to their local station on my own üòÄ.\n\nNot too much time for talking by the time we got to their house, as it was a work night, and I was ready to sleep!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YpxwglsXTT8JzseiIcPlRVnH3S4G4HgK?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kR3OqWd6_tJ02rgtm9YUuKe7MBUhXqE-?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yeKDKE2j6T79kTdH4pU4QwhKoLGlLlqB?authuser=0"}]}
