We spent 3 days in a row at the Remarkables, and pretty much all were bluebird. Emma and BJ joined us for the last 2, and that was heaps of fun - seeing them board pushed me to try some new stuff, and it was great to have more people to share the holiday with for a short while.\n\nHad some delicious meals so far as well! Coyote Mexican (nachos and chimichanga, some of the best I’ve ever had) Brazz (with Emma and BJ - steakhouse; we had ribs, steak, and parmi) Hikari Japanese (with Emma and BJ - delicious Japanese food; we had sushi, gyoza, chicken katsu, mussels, tempura udon, beef teriyaki, and a bunch of tasty sake!). Ended up going out to Barmuda after dinner - lots of fun and interesting watching the bartenders make cocktails!Coyote Mexican… again (with Emma and BJ - shared dips, and had enchilada + chimichanga, fajitas, squid (sizzling dishes), and magaritas and tequila shots!).\n\nThis was Emma and BJ’s last night in town, so we ended up going to a few bars (Sundeck, Bunker, Zephyr) to farewell them - again plenty of fun just hanging out!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wCRgBLNSYaJH8XIneHqsdIyVgNAgrk-5?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15my6YigeboVeLECbBN3rSx_8uo2NwBPe?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XbhB2uShpVFRkgY02C2jKgND6qAVvNRg?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KLvwv_o3VEes8gBcPgJlmifiKzA7yZIY?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HiBsk6XYsCA7iUhulPVByvJndZKsz481?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j1F_Ao-Dx7Mb3qdw1vxtBdfby1LbxFcx?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f_laXF-Gbg5eGAJqF3Wp0qs_ZrBaMluW?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14txsUQxh4WzXIF-lTK0yb5zCf5ycuUMz?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qUCDd37FltBzeSyKTzeGfWcUXYPQ__5a?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14fjUMTfuxmZ6VhaB6qghEaTx_Wgw5Qhm?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oz8-U-TkNHSD-o5ifKFZZCc9fA2B1d5s?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1y2OiAt1xNFgSLpurEm654k3CCL41v-83?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nxTGqwMi-CIMxUI7Ip5KJmt96e8DWQ4u?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EKJ0-l4aNstlc1_0JgnqfJ4wdDrQnFIT?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/185ypfng0PTEvQc7F3VS5j555zKHBX5Va?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mAHzU2VYQNgdGlqj3SFHgXxvo_k37eok?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EQI4zYXKpRKrSx3L6Nc71G9Q13e7duRC?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PMtEzHABkzBeTcEMyMG35CDX2_yPEKFz?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-dTgJ6s5yQernT418_6d_TjsNhbKuaIz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18l3HaSjy6YKcxU09B2H2je0lq0kIVcLk?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R9rNm-fsWvadrL6kJPWvqdE0ef-jQGaJ?authuser=0"}]}
