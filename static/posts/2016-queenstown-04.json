Kris was unwell and stayed off the mountain these two days, so it was just me to cruise Cardrona.\n\nI had heaps of fun exploring a good chunk of the mountain over the days - lots of varied runs of all different difficulties!The mountain has some amazing views around the valley as well. The gross selfie is facing back to Queenstown, and was completely silent when I took it - was an unusual and relaxing place to stop for a few minutes.\n\nOn the drive up the mountain on the last day, I met 3 French girls hitchhiking to the top for a day on the snow. Something I wouldn’t normally do, but I had the room in the car, so I gave them a lift! Was different and fun to chat to them on the drive, and is kinda the way so many people are friendly on the slopes! Unfortunately didn’t get a photo for proof, but that wasn’t on my mind haha.\n\nOn the same day in the afternoon, I was getting more used to a few small jumps and things in the small park. The top photo is probably my best attempt at doing a grab off a jump, and there was a photographer there to capture it! This was really fun to try out and get better at over the few days at Cardrona!\nDefinitely had a lot of fun here - so much variety in the runs, and plenty of places to force me to get better!\n\nDinner was The World Bar burgers! Really chill place with tasty and well-priced food!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nX6bKRRqcxkf7qDM7RLeGIR4shNwemuX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14UrJTMVNdI4c9_FvRaGvvPyhC5ZCcDZF?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f1gm47r1scFC15I-YUe0GOdiZQu9jpGI?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-mjj_Yd3P4gyp5CL1gcGlmu8gDsfNeq2?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rYFFD-BHpvMYZknFwIb4P2XaRzTWoDVd?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RgW_SffxA8jKulI1XvQCGwiD215bVIrj?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qa6-XHVGZGIGAzkOhU-00NlFdFNDlzKN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1e31FN-z69dQj8RE9TOXPFzHxQ3_v0QLn?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GhQ_Fh-nn_xDs7IBCgdGZjCWb-ddRDG1?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12SvVfs4DkEyygX6NJNqoeeecpIZsR06Z?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rOeYqt_PuND9XRidVHQQCh0cZ-zu1Y2u?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BAGBUvSb2L0gyl3hrED_UHET9Q-5XmcI?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16nXzOF0AxSLLt9qLn-kCIfdYySygBiP-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hJdqZVrQ7hTTeNZ0XPrUsDDaWmFhCz0i?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1thoE_XE5cXIXRSvcgLdd8wDSyTtKP2iU?authuser=0"}]}
