The area around the station has recently been renovated (ongoing), so I had a look at the ‚Äústream‚Äù development with all the new shops fronting it - is a very nice strip lined with plum blossoms that might be in bloom soon!\n\nNext I headed to Yoyogi park and Meiji shrine, stopping for a coffee along the way. The day was really nice just to relax a little and go at a slower pace through the park. The shrine had a lot of signs along the path showing the history since it was completed - this year marks the 100th anniversary. There is a public holiday on Tuesday, and there seemed to be a lot of indications the place will be filled then.\n\nAfter spending a good bit of time in the park, I had to head back to Shibuya to meet Tristan for lunch. We met near the Hachiko statue (a popular meeting place), then found a sushi train for lunch - this was mostly very nice (only one dish didn‚Äôt do it for me)! Quite well-priced as well.\n\nWe continued on to Shinjuku after lunch, and went up the metropolitan government building to the observation deck for a look over the city. The day was somewhat clear, but not enough to see Mt Fuji.\n\nI spotted a flea market in a nearby park while we were high up, so we went there to take a look for something different, then we headed back to the house to chat and play some games for a bit of relaxation üòÅ.\n\nNaoko made dinner tonight (oyakodon plus other vegetables) - this was a delicious meal that looked like it came from a restaurant!\n\nFinally for the day was a visit to their local bath house. This was such a great experience! So much larger than I expected, and the variety of baths and things to do was fantastic - cold baths, hot baths (indoor and outdoor), saunas, jet (spa) baths, electro bath, and a water floor thing that you lay on to relax! We spent time in most of these totalling about an hour and a half. Then we enjoyed some green tea in a tatami seating area before we headed home. So much more of an experience than I was expecting it to be!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a_cpZpHEGCqjHj8GLdqCLeCZiebvyD0G?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vztkESVht-ELV2H0faZu6BIkSQOxrfXH?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Z05SypFcbiaAH6BWbe8kANjn878WUZWb?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1poh-Ex7MvLlnfyYs600_yW7LWQQTREr0?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1I2GdjkZ3NB7VXhoR-Cyq4uDP3vETOPuY?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qwJSQv00tSMynlv3QNiGYe1GlHW7eSd2?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kl9yqoCHrh6IXg2y30zNkah7JRohEjED?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oTkAbmTKYimPLOmKtW5GW_3lfjDTdjpm?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gBNlgkvb6fJjC2zpid5a2czKVLovPCzQ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vpD8rRDytE6ADULXESs0sbP4V0F12OV6?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jO-IvBxiToxqcGX2QbFoxvgU-4FP3Tig?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i3jyNVPGMnb2Nj1h43Wmlxw8yzMnWwxT?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pQatq58fIwbhIMKT0pcNFJPogFK0ySAA?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IFHPC4W3XLW97xqlLbkEQwCBsuSP5nCs?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15fXCBFg48vtbs5mb6hd75dHnLMJlfFpd?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nBpUabAWUfZ_OZZOWFhChNhyQIgCOlgw?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/123VRYUV6fNFxjHS7aD576rqH7z-20YUX?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uSclEJMGJbAa-mzDcMGjm2iIxgVGekGN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-5OUlAbl5K9ZJyhDP7ehHpxnO6KCbxAg?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UR0k6xym7BguU0Pjxkp1fvPYFFCtOXuM?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ofbz0639wlmW8iwR1yqB2QC0sZAd0Hog?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pQEFNRT6eiyQnqhXoyIWwpeS3IAu5Wl3?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tsXM_6Pbpe7bug0a9b5k7Q9Qf3kmkoMd?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14mOAjQfVZFxTcYrBtxJmnFT9FIdpsFYc?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Jq4-OkXWi5BP2IwS0tqtRyeZkGwG8xXq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11t8iXl1m-bzZUPlpo_RWtL7DOK_UtrNH?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vPfV2mpfhRiwtMgg0klr20KchCjc3F-U?authuser=0"}]}
