{"id":"2020-japan-12","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 15","title":"Yamagata - Yamadera, Kajo park","content":"With all the long travels and busy days happening, today would be a bit of a change.\n\nIt was time to do some washing, and the hotel had a coin op laundry room, so that was just after breakfast.\n\nOnce that was sorted (clothes all over the room to do their final dry), I made my way to Yamadera.\n\nThe main attraction here is Hojuzan Risshaku temple - a buddhist temple built high up some mountains, away from the town below.\n\nImmediately after stepping off the train I knew I was going to like the place - you could see buildings of the temple grounds scattered on the side of the mountain in the distance, and the mountain side itself was also more textured and interesting than normal.\n\nAfter a short walk to the base of the hike, I paid the small admission fee and got to it (many more stone steps! Though these weren’t covered in snow thankfully). The entire hike to the main grounds had stone statues and carved rocks lining the path. The sheer number of “things” scattered about made the hike really unique and interesting, and that was on top of the beautiful natural setting all around - large cedar trees and moss covered rocks everywhere.\n\nThe gate to the main temple complex marks about 2/3 of the steps throughout the whole area, which branches out a little after the gate. It’s not huge, but definitely larger than I expected for the location!\n\nThe buildings were mostly fairly typical, but the location and the views made the whole experience much more interesting. I couldn’t help but think what it must have been like when large numbers of monks lived there - again my reference for these thoughts comes from anime I’ve seen haha.\n\nI’m very glad I made the trip to the area - it really was quite awe inspiring!\n\nThe rest of my afternoon was just walking about Yamagata, with the only real noteworthy place I visited being Kajo park - a large park in the center of the city that was the site of a castle in the past (now only a handful of structures remain, including the moat and raised wall). This made for a nice easy walk to finish off the day, and got me thinking how impressive it would look in spring or autumn (heaps of blossom trees and I think maples).\n\nAnd that wrapped up my few days north of Tokyo! Tomorrow I head back for a couple nights before the main journey west!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ysd3u83sB9qMuphffI270_nC3Dm65eL4?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13hMnaxPXqFtz5b5cSCo65BgzvTeJkSSJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1El3epVksHBsDk9mv5JFdLz_v5I9uMn9X?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pMEemW7mb-hQzDyXAmERV9byRWHRQV2E?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SKXL4TTU5Se2bKtijMRp83Z85qPKXDFo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10xrJgN3WiCNn_po1QYcJIXRLB3AAzZrR?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MjS4TLXcGONCTeCMTvPQnPzychU5WGkQ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wx3APfw5JhkUfKfZfL1EX_RAq27emwMK?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16DpmnbCFWNkQPofCkvk07b-Q5fzN44C_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AJ2-IE_tWkFqF_kNtWwHwcZoAdzjU18b?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12-F5zfeiamdxHR1kcN0vOLeYCBw730SJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i6u5WLTHzTlQnoEHP_pP7BxLUc3C0kby?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ozarSus4NB_QrXpaYSQwuulhExwdBFb-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Kz_tOiiFIb9ijniL33tkEev3fnabvO_V?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1re6GXAXVpkI_1UuSWDDGbN7L_x7Px7QQ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LrwZ6korDVAOv7uOLvmuHlfWzc1WGIc0?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1d4aefc-VpD4WJnkN0J0T9pUmxKcE1rtl?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XDrPDsek6g34H5d5Gw3OGlXdaXu_I6qj?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1STAFMI3VyIw8oB2ZxHhW6YZObXiGSaJV?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EZDnLmZwf4csEy2MBB60_tDH7oV7DtEI?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dy7LGVHa0D_3nbaPkTM151nuC_3gx78T?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13WKQoph1kJylcjAZuZpFBlbikOCpdBAz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1P2pbHk7pFXKU2Ab9-Lx7c_g18KfAHv1G?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Hv0JP7EB5N4v5_He0sl4MUhmTon4MHNt?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bzgf_seyMQJx4ZSjjgLkteBQYWg_o1Il?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BUo2ohCy8D95mYb-3yPqHyPBmkcpfcop?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a2IEh-7sOWxAk47kjToGhj8UwlU3FO08?authuser=0"}]}
