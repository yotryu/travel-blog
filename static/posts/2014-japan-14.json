It started with snow falling in Kyoto when we woke up (only a tiny bit but was still something different!).\n\nFirst stop was Himeji to visit the castle there. On the walk through the main street to the castle, we got swamped by pigeons when we sat down to eat some doughnuts on the side of a park! They wouldn’t leave Trent alone cause he was holding the rubbish bag haha.\n\nUnfortunately the main keep of Himeji castle is undergoing a huge renovation right now (not finishing until March 2015), but we still saw very impressive structures and the grounds around the main keep. So much history in the place, and a bit of it was documented in the walk through the west structure that was open. \n\nWhile we were walking through the grounds we noticed a large group with a film crew - it looked like a couple of local TV show hosts doing a piece on the castle with a small group of people watching and laughing at the 2 joking around. Being the only obvious foreigners in the castle grounds, we stuck out like a sore thumb and they came over to chat to us! After some meaningless chat, Trent asked for a photo. The lady was prepared to take the photo, but we wanted her in it! Her partner jumped on board and took the camera from her and insisted she get a photo with us haha. This was hilarious - we have no idea what will happen with the footage of us talking shit and making fools of ourselves, but if it winds up on Japanese TV, we will be amusement for a stack of Japanese people ;)\n\nOnce we finished with the castle, we had lunch at a small place just outside the grounds. This was one of the most delicious meals we’ve had so far! I had a pork curry and the others had a “local specialty” (rice, pork and a “demi glace” sauce). We were so impressed by the meals that I decided it was time to try out complimenting the staff by telling them we thought it was delicious (“oishii”) - the reaction was incredible! Once the staff member I told realised, she quickly told all the staff in the restaurant, we heard them excitedly talking, then as we left we were showered with constant “thank you\"s (\"arigatou gozaimasu”)! Trent gestured it was delicious (a tasty kiss motion) and that threw them in to overdrive! No question this was an experience in itself, but they deserved it - the meal really was amazing, and to see them take such pride in their cooking that a compliment like that produced that reaction was heartwarming :)\n\nThe afternoon was spent in Kyoto - check it out in part 2!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZRGQfJJs_OHgPJo2oXbQOQ7SQ9boO9ER?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wjJpQCnjTt38Kd0lQNP8SCDzVfGwhbBG?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1U_S1YmjWqKZfTKMaY4zcVg3uz3H-hsoN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1o8JrrWJ7WNluP724CsqTA_Pw_ntHxkGW?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1M9ROJ5l4IrigSfgqLl2xciLXWa3zoMa7?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Uh1Hu0kYED_yNBjFfqQmSDGduqpLMWnR?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DKZ4THyATl_455T49A3mMReXGx19NULV?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yeQ9_xLyIvmUpqJegbwTTEZ8S_XDhsDo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16NNx7tzuiBluut1-za46_FSz6052SyMr?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14miaMsipq895ASdJI7yDNRPesKKq_R34?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qq9MCbqaiSLBhIpl36sA8F2lD-izm8Kf?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FjNic6m5_XsPdA9NstFTt1etYE6QLNVs?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UwlFFdLEpKSGNNVKbjds7M_KFVSTEOVw?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1x_e2JRCyJp4SNBy_oR580x1rgzb4Wk_V?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zICQ_ujl-NU7AryQGh2bbWoCsNZArxs5?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dw-pLumPvDl0y6tS6JkxJB4lKsTqiuT-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bq_F6qbkCwfAQ_IK_UWL2OlnJxdA-d6R?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t1MxHLpYl_Bm00kJ29TAlaqnDrzJnmBt?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WOGsOqWJpvKeyWig6jMDOm3qFyl9ttzH?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10dIKjB8AXrDaNf86bzB6H-BWVeAtDbt0?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QAw601bt072AJbrZKx8BfUy6IrU9-e0P?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eydVtbWgPzCoAFteduVmlZTe1ZSPcWGp?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-tf4HJo7JKt-wYXxkp0yt2iwEv7YeoGc?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xSjY0-Sr6ghd1YswCt9qE__chY76xEzr?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-j6dqzfetdQZH9YK1t0N2RBbDoYltPZu?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KVILvPJKc0CSSDdx3AiGWzpnQzKiXq1q?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10TIyqSCU7TXOR_BlCKN9r9CtYlOG-iXU?authuser=0"}]}
