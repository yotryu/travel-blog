Tristan had suggested a place to grab melon bread in Asakusa, so I headed there first.\n\nThe melon bread was delicious! Freshly baked and very popular, it was the perfect blend of crispy outside and fluffy light inside.\n\nFrom here I continued to Senso-ji, scoping out restaurants along the way. After a bit of a look around, I picked a restaurant with a nice looking teriyaki chicken lunch set - this was a fantastic last meal to round out the trip.\n\nAfter lunch I went to the Imperial Palace grounds for a look - they were setting up a lot of tents and things, I think in preparation for the emporer's birthday event, so the views weren't as impressive, though it was neat to see just how much setup was going on.\n\nI spent the rest of the afternoon having some snacks in Ueno park, reflecting on the trip and enjoying some down time.\n\nWhen it was time to leave, I picked up my luggage from the hotel and caught the Skyliner direct to the airport. \n\nAnd with that, the trip was pretty much over. It was a different sort of a trip, but spending time with Tristan and his family was excellent 🙂","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Hg0k098pS8pg20NabuPzlc6BOL0y7ahS?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Jluk3SkKhkzP89Tj9L5G7XbSI7BK7Ybb?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pncUHw8Z5AkF-kVB1LnwtvDvSiDR358K?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14zZOWjmgPdaSvVosLv1XuZUdpHtPWywF?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kzpg_y5VcsV6jk17r4V-huddbrGR2K-n?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14kUN6FYX2Je2jVD7BJYCOx6LY8DrrYWH?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mVHKncGXmf6_DJw8gOtK6JHWQnh99XXV?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B6B7bMob9kN9GD6DtMyIP4Wy8Q_vcjLE?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wyszyTGaoJx_zMGig0FF4oDvvvxMLA2L?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mom4WX_uWL3ODCJ2O-TwFWI7PeYOsafG?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TuZpGnBqhRRdQvh55GQ9NabG4qzUM8Ed?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15LIDwPRL-D_MphQCz5xGPdKvGg4KY3sC?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jkVOFOIqhqlwN6etytmTcBrp-Nxp_7py?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FeaTTB22K9am686xqS4H3n4fVOHx5pYD?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13VZdyE0JJr5hdqYeC-S7aJaOiE4zBEKr?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eeM6Coxxc8qhmQLd3jDoDZnSJ0GldYSp?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hA1uCFAHK5w4vuhy1eGVkUALvnWUTPTT?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1M72Hx9xQTzEfCavPLvQx7L01Lgo-IduG?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16tg4v6wwuySVGgSa_fXFyBh5Gs0VxX8o?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RmEYpoADymFa0ik_qAq0uK5kD4OUSvpH?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DjZlBN5LHj1FwhmnHPr9vZECGiHhEyps?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14pD4r8aPiXlH-9obbY0kQli9-Jy13n5A?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15RHbRFjRGXXVKfHfb8agsKE411slWgOq?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VYlyFElxSGMnOuc1rZ4VhCHBqs-2IThR?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KjLxaQeywv06Yacp9k44-jdiAA76efC7?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1faIjAJQpPkEsKGIUx_eV45Noy-120KCu?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NkCHPiEVQetmbjzm7YiukguFX3u9wSWM?authuser=0"}]}
