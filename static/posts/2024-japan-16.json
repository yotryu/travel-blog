First stop was a coastal area with caves which were used hundreds of years earlier as a strategic hideout for boats. We used a lift to reach the caves, then wandered through the route, seeing and reading about how they were used.\n\nWe had a couple more small stops along the coast, one to see \"coin island\", then found ourselves at a rather large fish market. This was fascinating - so many stores, all preparing fresh seafood in all kinds of ways, and people buying so much of it. Customers would speak to the workers to negotiate purchasing certain cuts which were then expertly prepared and packaged - it was really cool to see.\n\nWe had some pancakes and fruit with coffee for lunch before doing some last minute ceramic shopping at a large stall outside the fish market.\n\nDinner was delicious Indian in the shops near the hotel.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1v14bDaB8-RskZWKUY14Wp1HD-roiP3p-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lhYSwYbTMYEDQG-fMWrBZqE-O_1RMu-W?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tof8w7RRAROn6L5iK4UtliU900AjCKN7?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mTzJliqqgB6GiNvPKCV8Cahd1wbUva12?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SMNGFzCiel2Sht0Kn_IqOA3suVAyEXS8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ijd841sVS8YaMXxXmU8B8KbaR-o5I6Jz?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_79Q_NfiNTKu2q47PZ7o5mcsKKYMDnjX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vxPSS-v0pWUBLE6_IXInTnl7yCQJyEn3?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vMzmD5588Sc1batVHcCSGcovkZW3EOiY?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mGJWZ2SYETXF5ygOsWbhndRxtcloQob7?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lQSnKQwx1R-9ydxy5ZvbNqPwmsB56Pr1?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1b_-LVHAySGwVzxVYENIZD14TzVRL3bHn?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sbAgJtBOcjH1nM4ON0nAx_mACuCWg-EM?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1C_l54O7-KKDlxcyLepTTl2kWisTJYBCN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HIBcBv86he1Hh8aJMFSLp08DIagZ8SnN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bMzigHWI8vCBACOuxoCHjdCzKu6Ftsz8?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aDCD2bN4H1YKmhKqkVQdK_fBw56bnRM7?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18xWrOwe0zDgRucdH0ssZ_Y48wnNAMJCy?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tAdmfXCr5aT4G9LuDZFsIg9Stgs4kueP?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10QTuerNksUOorI4nkrMR3OAIcG6RKs3O?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1h7HzQW0VyUkaYTwMQcvODlYiR4hIHj60?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CeGPjD0IiXXvNJAKa27Zh1oIoybGTPhg?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PEVTWrEuE04O4YlhPmasKGuckCghHelA?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Na5ezGizX0qHZmq0ME826iRi3mo95VpQ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17IenFtByf9XmkLEZH93rD2-U_0rSn8eN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1afsThVWD_tPaB5k_72GVU_FQe7mVUDOU?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1I-9U0mFqra8Jhm1JwrxT9Uw-Z_FCsCYq?authuser=0"}]}
