We had one day left for the remarkables, so went there for a very chill final day. The vibe was the most lax Iâ€™ve experienced on the snow. Pretty much bluebird, somewhat quiet, decent snow, warmish day. It was a real nice relaxed way to spend the final day!\n\nKris even made it up the top of the Sugar bowl chair for this one! Progress all round :)\n\nLast night dinner was Lone Star! Had a great waiter for the night - very relaxed and fun guy, and the food was great too!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wBFDUHDygiICp7sFKZKNiFbU7JWaFlwo?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Diqd3wmq1FymYGJvnu9cYF9iGsNnRGNH?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pwRbW12fw7kvCrw_H0RNjsloupVVxVL4?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19F1otEaArfWg-PSGtmgZtnDigXlMpb0j?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rS9aosDAPJLtqTd3kkMm1rErzmwFWj3o?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XFaWZoya2T7Stu2InBmt96ZprHOoNJoA?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WTPs4GOaS30R1mW4FYPpXIRDNesot08g?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qvkoA1kK0lmqAaRRzuzFmeOHpyRffcn-?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1e4MnvEyAqx0sv-SBzVM7chLI4mnOy5mr?authuser=0"}]}
