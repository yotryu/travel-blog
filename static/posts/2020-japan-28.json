I ended up waking up late and decided to just relax and take my time with breakfast and checking out (check out was until 11).\n\nFrom there it was straight to the subway to get back to the Shinkansen station, reserve a seat for the train ride, and grab a bite to eat before the 3 hour ride back to Tokyo.\n\nAs usual, the ride was very comfortable and routine at this point! The last long train journey of the trip.\n\nI was able to time the trains to meet Tristan at his local station and walk to their place for a quiet afternoon catching up before we headed out for one last dinner together before I leave.\n\nDinner ended up being at a nice restaurant with lots of variety in the meals to choose from. I had katsudon while the others shared 2 different meals with beef, chicken, and pork. Katsudon isn't a particularly adventurous Japanese meal, but it is a very popular one, and I definitely enjoyed it!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1c0erHkkB4_EaFuJ3c6uBWJhmmeZsFaDI?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dhApGIjj8MWIC7SeLSqO5KYCcJYRSEw2?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jR8ro10uBkmOipovGPXHx0JW7zMLWj-v?authuser=0"}]}
