{"id":"2013-usa-canada-11","collection":"2013-usa-canada","date":"2013 January 31 - February 1","title":"Yosemite National Park","content":"Had a stupid early morning to get to the train and out to Yosemite Valley - train ride was great then had a bus ride the rest of the way. Got to the place at a bit after 1pm, got lunch, then checked out Yosemite Falls and walked a bit of the valley loop and saw a small bit of the village.\n\nDinner was nice (restaurant was very good) but the room was nothing special.\nHad a good 3-4 hours the next day to see some more of the valley so went to Mirror Lake in the morning - very good decision! The place was incredible - a bit of a walk from the trail head but well worth it. After lunch we walked around some different areas near the village - saw some great different creeks and snow covered meadows.\n\nBus back was full of a tour group (this was painful…) and the train was a little cramped. Also saw some… interesting people on the bus transfer back to near the hotel haha.\n\nLong 2 days but well worth it!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14k56G5yAtSoEpGzi8oXWWF7P6jaBjeUZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Q9oyTlXGhQ1cKtXHkYHyo_e8UlT_HBiz?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GiOW8tHMnyZEQHUqyJXyBpWFMPjf3uoy?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tJ31M497ORZki5laXPplnn9kytiwjPqZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rl-AGXCE1SpgcVG3VTN0y9VrF5S_e80R?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15dL5Qf6R44MwTjJqs0sGqBudpRQgLvb_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Y10gVSMBZKel6Tpo9eW9ZBqwDCjoUNcd?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1w3JXbattKS8mrGJP33n-4Snl6sDDHdts?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SSO6DcDJLQ0D1Fsp7PlwS_0nU9WSVZMo?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qmNZlWXJ29cN5LIovljq7wJ5wa8AguCP?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tpsKPLL5kvYjNuA4-xJz39TwHZSPKACT?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aiizzbw3Am2WACBRrnYnlesVWAcEVvGq?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Z0OacsqoazyxG8BDP1l8Zm2tZ_btSFi6?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kWKk5ocoQf4Z0XcjUeMUWMptbHTdMFmX?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TrcuydpVcHHpmgaj68GlRdU_DGSMxWCz?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-Lo4SLXlfg0x1WsHViZV39bIpzYc_EG4?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mFsUh6upwjRZfKVFVVuciIaRGScSQPwB?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XT-jfR3p6tcmTut3536iLmpk4bHy_g8K?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1idzZkHqBOwDalI0a1LYLi0x5yTtNFA6F?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KKAXtOBP9wi_P3_VvhesZ3Y7Cw79nKJP?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t1B8m0WkeV4DsxWt_FNQhc1UYXAdfPUV?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10p1BO8ABHpSJyE-3-ysbBeZ_SRIsGo5F?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cdny9wseY5Scn86ZsGJxVWkx8eaFScQn?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pBnRbJh2LhS8F3luI72FaClbTOCWSHR3?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17kEep64pq9Hs4LXqifAPBQ9n93mDK607?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MrXWs04J7bkoe1kk_r836Fvg-ELZyEiN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10jGXHA1d9JZFTuZPtzLdjM_QDLX0yT6v?authuser=0"}]}
