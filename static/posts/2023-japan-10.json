{"id":"2023-japan-10","collection":"2023-japan","date":"2023 February 21","title":"Kamakura - Houkokuji","content":"Today I spent pretty much the whole day in Kamakura.\n\nI've been here a few times, so I wanted to see something different - this meant a 15-20 minute walk away from the main attractions to a different temple. The walk itself was very nice, going past all kinds of small shops and houses all very close to the street.\n\nHoukokuji temple was really nice! Very quiet compared to the main hustle and bustle, and the gardens were immaculate. The bamboo grove in the grounds was also fantastic - a smaller grove compared to Arashiyama, but without the crowds, it was more enjoyable. The smaller scale also gave it a more tranquil sort of feel. I definitely enjoyed seeing a different temple, and the sights along the way.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lq1BwbzmHbclrLHcn_Faae_U03jVLKR7?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TG5AL_mb1fYh0RtGNZLYE63rEzU-lNeM?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Z_LJCihJpH0LkYEJukGvxq1rWjeyiXmd?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19JPqlwyoZ6gcQg9KEkhzeOkBE3z7H1Ql?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Po4Xhj7P-zXIML7ewq9qLd4R043qvhx_?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zU7fMVDp_F1RJ0Dn432eQ1J1cEZYBHAf?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AhpbtPY3mDX_EM5QkazBHTmgmTk1ttML?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17zZdXOfYXWLalkj6zhi-HiSxOuf1u5VM?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1x24h7tvyl8iZmSOXHSlv7KUNAr0Diald?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LTMUgiaNt2qv0-5Rj2ZmNnjumqwyhU1K?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17XnMbZvseZXFaWNytvlgXaZhuc_-XSm_?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11NTUhUZ6AsYHIt-P4Gm3g6JamRpJNBiN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PSthYp_tuNwli6XaPYtdU2FuFf5mdVGz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HZMjJQmUg4nf7xCtQOKJ3mt0T8nWzwcj?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vtNs4LCSQ4zhR62z9IPUVr9xGrrzYmZe?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HWlQepgY9NVXkSiSDGeJbeLnLk7NZGTG?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NlCSKgAXudV7k2tz4DFET9izKt0GqTxm?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VU0JvplsMh5PPyohKq2cqrLSrhJFGv6F?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BYVR0wFS-hf2rkN2KJ6RpBF0HK6JH8sE?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KkO_EyJhfsApw2Osi2x9TA29c54xRltT?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17ds9PpVI1RZXSysCbK7qHzjChRTueD2D?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Y9Oh2r9_3Lm4OONRbr_BLeJ9-i14bG4Y?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16izO6R65HTaWvnr7c3ePMDILIXQtYVfo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-qoIKFAJiuuUgHJukbjzTPonESYs_wAE?authuser=0"}]}
