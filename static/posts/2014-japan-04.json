We spent a fair amount of time in Ueno park exploring shrines and around the lake. Everything was impressive, but the two standouts were watching people pray at the largest shrine in the park (Ueno Toshogu Shrine), and bird feeding at the edge of the lake. Heaps of ordinary people were visiting the temple, and most of them performed the same ritual at the entrance to the main hall - throw some money in to a large bucket, then bow twice, clap twice and pray. Watching this happen showed how ordinary people would take the time to do what was an important spiritual activity to them - a very interesting experience to witness.Once we got to the lake, we saw some people feeding a stack of birds. Intending to just get a look, we wandered over, then an old man with plenty of bread insisted that each of us take a turn at feeding the sparrows! He balled up the bread and showed us how to hold it to feed the birds. Heaps of sparrows then jumped on our hands and arms to get to the bread. This was a very unique experience, made special by the friendly old man.\n\nWe went to Asakusa and SkyTree in the afternoon, and those are in part 2!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16P34ftbrD3zfJz5gYgO8-2wlzi5hXqTd?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BtFYrlsoa3G3Jm-j3i12Rc9n8EGU2vFZ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j0Je1tjZpJM6Rnc_c4GXlB588jxaqrc9?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DsO-atVUGK5Am5DkgsvL2vtSNK5uCTXM?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YzAjzsWhbcj9I2rxArRHj-YuQ8jAO89m?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1A3Qd-HO7DOTzrTLAmjqnggqbCEFhZUsB?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1N7T0wfzqwPokjCRkEpnPqhMLjWo21c-J?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FMZ1g2V3q8bQpN6nSL0lzAOCP8DzWgUv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NoSUe6Lmp1uL9kF68Z8S34Lyoe8GHyLV?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xCDJEnpAhPhm3adbGpOL3vTrLgh-A0V9?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tmnDvSvr_fT6SrHaN7-KayxRaBSU2pd7?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IwTkAn_jLM5LMfw_Vr7k30FZ3bEC1TJN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rezehcjhK2dy-up4qKdi-DqAiDzPI88n?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AlAWIdLsFdSJyyOfrg2UuWxluMiAJJP6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FU3RURGZGvcRZ9tyQpCyB3Gtc0bW6Y_S?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YRYYGS1kptLJL7OY1rh6MDQ4R9EBgYTc?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ExrW_yBpTy6HzVs64t41JBUzqs4jdPsd?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NEWRROOm0vSIA_um-k_u_xWPj1dp-oCX?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1izOkx3EGxIgUnMLrz30MI8uB4l4QWYgL?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Tachg2eKHta71cj8MdomY2qg52RwwFrE?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a9h_WquNrlWKH2WX_9nOtfq01UX2rpBM?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KmKPqP6Qhlyv3QfHhhChUQsZiMUtWdIP?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kIfPik8WkfuBnAtqpLjcAcMyfv8Qdvqf?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Wtsv4eeS7NYmQVThAzKwlFREiOYJffPw?authuser=0"}]}
