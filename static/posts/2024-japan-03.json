We managed to snag a coffee from a small place with Australian manuka honey for sale before we had to meet up and jump on the bus again.\n\nOur next stop was Enoshima island, and this one we reached on time. Being an island, the local food options were mostly seafood, which we were happy to try. We stopped in at a place which was nice and lively and each had something delicious again.\n\nWe had enough time after lunch to do a little exploring - we all started on the over-island trek, but it was a lot of climbing steps, so not wanting to ruin themselves, most opted not to continue. I was keen to try and reach the caves entrance on other side, so picked up the pace and got going. I'm glad I did, as the views at the top and on the other side were awesome! Shrines and restaurants were scattered along the trail with some spectacular outlooks over the sea, and seeing Mt Fuji over the water was really cool.\n\nThen it was back to the bus and on to our next hotel.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i6GQcddANnNztwAYpseS5jo_2wsCbJj5?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kzeClyyCNka96TYdDRezB82jJOd06ARK?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f2UZkFR5uMxzrH5PCLrsWN48l7wRLe__?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19SiGj7K6kJLPW-TCpiy2giVuWJEPrNXh?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Fzvqu-Jr7DWrjEwt6z9XvyIXH3fAUH6N?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dMJQRnPWewzAX_MsxYENKXe1v4eJr9Hn?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IJ3r5BDp6iBiPkGY57rFi-_EAAjZ2HoZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SS3z1ENThFsLLCjDaGrWMgVi9nF_TYfC?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LshEHPWKRa6J4Oqn4ULhMCVxZ3fUidpe?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lxzZ1O9fUALU17BAM-63BXhN75GHpigz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-ABsNmLXSTP069ZynpbG1jFMptRB_Q_Z?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vPG_RRiZCkLTFBopFg0dWi6GKxlxGld_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gbyk_75KuYwxtdTjSZp0p9xO_VtIDMSn?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KhLRqz9sYKe0lwBtsb7cV11P3IJvBwk3?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nMtk8NUIaCYx8gRTI1qE2YK4h2TLsdAP?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uGXP3F9sYKRU9Oo7Ftmc4gO1y6VKJAEE?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ujPQEHh2lx2yb9YKXHnBiXJRubU5i6uz?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i8JgQL9k4kluEstWlZFAscEOPind8w6d?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19jlsAvys7aRF2oOCJywjpsswiCtWXWfn?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BMgUz_z648zMQ9PhSsQx8l2GY-48Y2mv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1J0KAzzhlDXadluCqlprzhL0l6Y1sTtNN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_CQ5HHK7lOvoatel0lWjROsYeBAJMlTt?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iXwSnGNmdHpDvvorOGx9ELkDwA9TuwxQ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UzjMGlfrw-0S3GJl4CQH06J1WATXDJbt?authuser=0"}]}
