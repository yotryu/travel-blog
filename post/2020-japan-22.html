It made for a unique feel to the area, but the main attraction was the canal area, lined with weeping trees and small shops in traditional style buildings. While the canal area was a bit smaller than I had expected, and only a couple of the trees had started to show leaves, it was still a nice place to see. I can imagine how nice it would be to grab a meal or drink in one of the small shops, and enjoy the atmosphere during spring with the trees full of colour!\\n\\nAfter another train ride I was in Onomichi. On the walk to the hotel I passed a restaurant that looked good for dinner, and the bike rental place, so I would be ready for getting into things quickly tomorrow morning!\\n\\nThe rest of the day was spent relaxing before having a bit of an earlier night in the hopes that I would be well rested for the long day ahead!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Dd3YIPUEFc0rPWCgb665KaY5Ov2_YhMb?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1d7ggofKcb_LpHxglrC6n67EnnjGaw4NG?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MQTC5hl7qxCbsNpwwbTpip7yrfnuRVQG?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bFJK-cL6hoMsUkLU3R2gaTAYuM2ei-8G?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yw42-etrpIsoBUpsAWVt7ieHzgP6UTZ-?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kK__enshBz8Lr2IGLjCFz-ci9a_SLljE?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fGe0cw3_WsvYKhIauYNAnGfkHP5JQ4vi?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BNcaXRmKTPZzdpL3FHuV2K8bphmBhXGj?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BUWQOIbRW6_1NiCRCIuQahvxufk2J_Zh?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18kaTCXvmF-k_EYJqHL4DCarB8jjJd1_d?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SN_hpBc-eNlibMbvKB7o7_hEg8AdCLj8?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dbJLzKIFmbjO-wW_0Ayx82WO4Vx8wgmG?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1irxDpYMTswbdS2q0CThzjwQMThOYar1Y?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1W-ZPFDwmnH8wKcXwHi1GBvM3JrXugrQ3?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RvVxB6LPOGlaoWdLlCDQGYc9vos2NnwA?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QCqElzb3gDfwu_kdo1KCiyf5WisjYWe_?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1frd4g1wqDbUZDd1Lf_Ax76I8ZM08bB4R?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BJcqr0jGL8Vl8g9ocG8wOO_h4ekjibXR?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ELQc7RGXES56Deks5PmCxecNku5BL_7D?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dADpGZSca3ikei43Kg1YmCINwkqgEgd9?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15RHVfM7SOoZFaSV9FdctXayWdUw4qThz?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lA5GAqezv85h3OwfIslS2VAkS1rc_3-R?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/110fO2JdfqJ1HH2EcTOPM1NcOLw4H5PMv?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LIm-b2r3-usK8Dt6YSxGhuB1Y7g91LrH?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CLD2ktE4ptE3_LVEqK1-ps0TRrAx-cz_?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Z0iwkGLTFUq9Cba8sTf79BsPBvYOhMa6?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Uo8ynyhUr0Av9x6mGsKh3ZT9D9IgbRi5?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

This was mainly due to it being easily accessible on the same subway from Tristan’s place, but also because it was early and would actually be open 😉.\\n\\nIt still looks as neat and tidy as I remember it, though because I stuck around for a little while, I got to see a procession of horses from the palace walk around the grounds for a bit. I suspect this was practice or training, as they stuck to a fairly simple circuit. Seeing the line of horses being followed by cars of people who would jump out to clean up droppings was particularly amusing - the devotion to cleanliness on display!\\n\\nAfter that unexpected morning, I decided to head to Odaiba - Tristan mentioned the Olympic rings were on display in the bay, and visible from Odaiba, so why not check it out.\\n\\nI walked the length of the main Odaiba strip along the shops on the waterfront to a viewing spot for the rings, nabbed some photos, then went to grab lunch - Japanese curry!\\n\\nBefore heading back to the house, I read about an attraction called “teamLab borderless” which was in the area, so decided to check it out. It was a bit pricey, but was a very interesting experience! It’s a “digital art museum,” with very interesting use of walls, open space, mirrors, and perspective to show the various moving pieces. Quite easily spent an hour or so there, and definitely enjoyed the experience!\\n\\nDinner was ramen and gyoza at a place ~5 mins away from the house - this was a nice meal, though noodles still fill me up too easily and I couldn’t finish it all…\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mXadXtS2XJMOjhnnoWG-XlaeLummj0ds?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tgtpKOh010IlnagSUHVJZnFms5VJ88lp?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eqc0o4WxAE0zbSgeYS9oZTq5wYyNmn1B?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1moUiO3kdbwsiGPRxgyoeH2tD0sa_isV4?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13l10BiSr32cTyQGk1-8XQFCNt33emMoR?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B_nC24HJHfY-LPiUdaAka6qzkCiugu0J?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19T6E8B0OT70-nN5FQwwZ5ZefM2E2kLmd?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wt9ReEnhJJZjh7cRIYF7Lib73yTuvQse?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rT0ZCbMIWTHziLajAdQPKcPBt4OY-GU0?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sHCmshf2VbPoa89Uv1oUlBbL16c_NrSr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15ld5s0jzBq2RqZ621LqvmR0DGwh6l--A?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xVko6WnUmjD-IwXGweDpye-o3XM4y51y?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1inonl66ctGtpUP3lud-Xff2poIioLe1i?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F_KojnjgoOGebpzsUDinjswGEowzJ9CL?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17U__5SjVfSGvLFcD19mhS_uzOyCXQQQ2?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jmBxrkW9FRpC7Q3v-HOwQzx-y7WMWN8n?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1G-G4czgQFRNYcmKHn-5bzIjA2V4KcRye?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10zvkFUoC-KIWwJ5TSu5GMw9e6f45MrOt?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mwezKyxR_4ykUlHObJ-DBtfkpqoE9Ph5?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CTvuzB62RS7DC4T8TD2Tu5KaUChTHpeB?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WyOq526dYq_HwYKVNkbpbt280Vc1JEpa?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZaEirgMQZJBC001oV9oY6nKOHmZWzEZg?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kI5E7DobuaAJwVZvVx1dSU-xM2NvYHuZ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JYwqtRytBKPSArL2MmI6mKNWkKGUHeJp?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1v1NhIs1sz6GcvB8lfEWT8tdVqrrltOi7?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ibzp8CSJPNuYM0_8QJBkcrbJ3IILczSe?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-U96E4y1xzZClj2jDcKa1OVZST3ZCoGH?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

The area around the station has recently been renovated (ongoing), so I had a look at the “stream” development with all the new shops fronting it - is a very nice strip lined with plum blossoms that might be in bloom soon!\\n\\nNext I headed to Yoyogi park and Meiji shrine, stopping for a coffee along the way. The day was really nice just to relax a little and go at a slower pace through the park. The shrine had a lot of signs along the path showing the history since it was completed - this year marks the 100th anniversary. There is a public holiday on Tuesday, and there seemed to be a lot of indications the place will be filled then.\\n\\nAfter spending a good bit of time in the park, I had to head back to Shibuya to meet Tristan for lunch. We met near the Hachiko statue (a popular meeting place), then found a sushi train for lunch - this was mostly very nice (only one dish didn’t do it for me)! Quite well-priced as well.\\n\\nWe continued on to Shinjuku after lunch, and went up the metropolitan government building to the observation deck for a look over the city. The day was somewhat clear, but not enough to see Mt Fuji.\\n\\nI spotted a flea market in a nearby park while we were high up, so we went there to take a look for something different, then we headed back to the house to chat and play some games for a bit of relaxation 😁.\\n\\nNaoko made dinner tonight (oyakodon plus other vegetables) - this was a delicious meal that looked like it came from a restaurant!\\n\\nFinally for the day was a visit to their local bath house. This was such a great experience! So much larger than I expected, and the variety of baths and things to do was fantastic - cold baths, hot baths (indoor and outdoor), saunas, jet (spa) baths, electro bath, and a water floor thing that you lay on to relax! We spent time in most of these totalling about an hour and a half. Then we enjoyed some green tea in a tatami seating area before we headed home. So much more of an experience than I was expecting it to be!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a_cpZpHEGCqjHj8GLdqCLeCZiebvyD0G?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vztkESVht-ELV2H0faZu6BIkSQOxrfXH?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Z05SypFcbiaAH6BWbe8kANjn878WUZWb?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1poh-Ex7MvLlnfyYs600_yW7LWQQTREr0?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1I2GdjkZ3NB7VXhoR-Cyq4uDP3vETOPuY?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qwJSQv00tSMynlv3QNiGYe1GlHW7eSd2?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kl9yqoCHrh6IXg2y30zNkah7JRohEjED?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oTkAbmTKYimPLOmKtW5GW_3lfjDTdjpm?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gBNlgkvb6fJjC2zpid5a2czKVLovPCzQ?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vpD8rRDytE6ADULXESs0sbP4V0F12OV6?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jO-IvBxiToxqcGX2QbFoxvgU-4FP3Tig?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i3jyNVPGMnb2Nj1h43Wmlxw8yzMnWwxT?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pQatq58fIwbhIMKT0pcNFJPogFK0ySAA?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IFHPC4W3XLW97xqlLbkEQwCBsuSP5nCs?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15fXCBFg48vtbs5mb6hd75dHnLMJlfFpd?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nBpUabAWUfZ_OZZOWFhChNhyQIgCOlgw?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/123VRYUV6fNFxjHS7aD576rqH7z-20YUX?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uSclEJMGJbAa-mzDcMGjm2iIxgVGekGN?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-5OUlAbl5K9ZJyhDP7ehHpxnO6KCbxAg?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UR0k6xym7BguU0Pjxkp1fvPYFFCtOXuM?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ofbz0639wlmW8iwR1yqB2QC0sZAd0Hog?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pQEFNRT6eiyQnqhXoyIWwpeS3IAu5Wl3?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tsXM_6Pbpe7bug0a9b5k7Q9Qf3kmkoMd?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14mOAjQfVZFxTcYrBtxJmnFT9FIdpsFYc?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Jq4-OkXWi5BP2IwS0tqtRyeZkGwG8xXq?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11t8iXl1m-bzZUPlpo_RWtL7DOK_UtrNH?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vPfV2mpfhRiwtMgg0klr20KchCjc3F-U?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

It’s only 5 minutes away by bike to the main area, and the place is quite large! Heaps of footpaths to walk or ride down, heaps of gardens and trees (including cherry blossoms which would be insane in bloom), and heaps of open space where families were having fun together, and others were practicing instruments! Oh and there are various sporting fields / grounds where kids were competing and practicing.\\n\\nWe rode around about half the park, then walked around a small section to see some areas a bit closer before we finished up sitting and chatting on seats near our bikes. Had a very friendly and community sort of feel to the whole place which made it a nice pleasant way to spend a little time.\\n\\nAfter we got home, I got myself ready to travel to Nikko for the night. This took a while with all the trains required to get to the town, but was easy enough. Saw some nice countryside and small townships on the local train, but was quite surprised with Nikko itself once I arrived and got off the train - it looks and feels kind of like a snow mountain town! Very pleasant surroundings and the town itself is neat and nicely laid out for tourists.\\n\\nNot many photos as my timing of arrival was just as the sun started to disappear behind the mountains, so better photos tomorrow.\\n\\nAccommodation for the night was in a ryokan called “Annex Turtle Hatori-An” - a very nice smallish place with a great view out the bedroom window! And the owner was a lovely lady who lives in the place (she made sure to point this out when explaining attractions on a map) and did a fantastic job giving a tour around the whole building to show and explain all the things available. Was a positive first impression, and that continued for my stay.\\n\\nDinner was “neapolitan spaghetti” from one of few restaurants in the area near the ryokan, and it was delicious! I wasn’t expecting anything amazing, but felt like a change of food for one meal so was willing to accept it might be average. I don’t know what herbs and spices were in the “sauce” for the dish, but it was so full of flavour, and the price was great too.

This whole area is perched on a hill at the end of the main street through town, which gives it a nice secluded feel.\\n\\nThe main shrine to visit here was Toshogu, which is the resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu. I went here because it was highly reviewed, but I still wasn’t really expecting to be as impressed by it as I was. The size of the complex is huge compared to other shrines I’ve been to, so it had more of everything, and the structures all had insane detail and effort put into them. And all of this was before I reached the “inner shrine” where Ieyasu rests. Getting to this involved climbing a decent number of stone stairs to reach the highest point of the shrine complex. This area was beautiful, even if it wasn’t the most extravagent part of the shrine - the natural environment around the area really added to the whole feel of the place!\\n\\nAfter really being blown away by Toshogu, the rest of the shrines and temples in the area were more typical - not unimpressive, just not to the same level as Toshogu haha.\\n\\nA walk back to the train station marked the end of my time in Nikko, but there was still time left in the day by the time I got back to Tokyo.\\n\\n(One more post follows for today!)\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QhJ60EZodnORzb_AO-TGIOmQsQHtDGZj?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SwJSSP0KAD53h66NdZmd33qwYh8-SWpm?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10q3LvcPzvplRKc-cTiMcl470Bb_Xfkk6?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ba1hTZ4LeA9Rz9BMU219V5j5QnY-c9je?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m8F5DJhhm8chCLsxKIHm4A2LUxWojkAI?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TA8UQHx4uPJl7b_R-FDs62OZdQE0_KhG?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TGMChYvVaTO7dCOCq6NhsODnWXn26f-T?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eb2dDN_JSx38e4UiCaMezRjBfKn8IoIQ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wXrvoC66T93CLwlA7q-vs_BQuxKABj7v?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1N17fP2Mf5ZtWvuv3dhX22pKNyj4wep5g?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HP2tnLSTWJOLFBpClSmfKaW7QzSBq19v?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vuUxjUuwawka2JWkkf6QQKNHCFytfdE_?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jj25ZmoUOW5GCDc9NYu1V-7xqt6mdd5w?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F7hbNAML6DmJ81MO1EevgvNDjDKv2034?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zm8sb_gOoOvHrwFLpL-v97-fsh96ivhy?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rApgwfmWJjLqvgXS2Ga5iGwQc6fazzYr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t04YfPJZHKAWCOcVsf2Bo7KjmkYg3gBG?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oXvOM-NbFsLGWl2yVHNAn2H3PUw5fdsm?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OCr4QRs3hHRqnbRf6pfQQEf5MeNSLq6Q?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uig1fSvnJEMmxel3e8I9Z0XH6YupENFj?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tJYVuM3z4henwRPqxkKUJwdFt2udHdJq?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TRB96DwAJTk0tHJv14-Cir9ek9gN_Hui?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xQ1BIBWQkd5d3uDEOi3S4jEw-43Jzn8x?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dV_PO-JMqu6KfWYGR30e9uXb5bq26gpJ?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17crCcQDQgROdZUEAQeM8lGru9H0lBGiO?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mxcy-Qv5mANdA8TaLoMHBvl-rJxwHa2m?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CLP-xShGSZIrVFoGPLS2qvTn4l8GcHv7?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

After the rides started closing, we parted ways and I caught a train to Kawaguchiko to stay the night.\\n\\nDinner was delicious teppanyaki from a very small local place (3 tables).\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MwtorAlMpiJ4RFbmBJHmys8G_zeLZ3vc?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Efj6BG5PVdDBG_j_fGCsburd1tnHUGOU?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kRcXcfTJDQ9p4z3RixEZXYQhj4k89gAX?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15I1DmPs5XmLSUUD-ym5Kjh9lf9akRIQ6?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZbUUxoOJAxT2ZM0eQkCz2FszBlWkdfhd?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a3hG4Jqc-xKq7N9lg9ZKeT53rgI7vaiP?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RWjJZIb2tPto1t53QUR6BCvSqw60t3m-?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hYm68Wf-Vg4lhtJKp02BR3RMK7X24oDJ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t_NTFhDMpLe6HqyljtNK08mmqvc8UrPP?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QOXELBAfkmAGxK8IWzuAciynUAjUwc3-?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Kfs4Pf4UvBaGDNm5QThz8dIMPpLeAO11?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18B01Kmj4-9Xvxv5KnSjYB5PqWW_8ksrS?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eU8jL2HQX99FmEF0Y0WHziyFqOUj6UF_?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pH6_j-J7Vg_MMNjozAwJqWKGB2ydZA4b?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UQahXw-XnWDXjO4jnYRMp7d-AONUatOc?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EbFokN5AWvbs28_gHDWrTw_iil0nnfLq?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MWZHnzFcSl001bXw4RtyEo8FqdrpPrqY?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TwP_5Tlur_N2EBpnXr_OmjIpdIpwkrSg?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vNMoAAWJ0j94Cb1QA2lDe934NVsWKI1H?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mqz4KaawWUO5gJbUiio4pvmoszXo8d66?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KwZzsUIkzqtL-5D_RxkF-bvVmrQbY5BA?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

It turns out I was the only guest staying with them tonight! They were very informative and explained the layout of the building and where the main areas were, then once they knew I was planning to hike up Mt Haguro, gave some advice and information on the condition of the trail! They even let me borrow an umbrella just in case I needed it for the hike!\\n\\nThe hike itself was impressive, both in scenery and challenge! There are over 2400 steps (according to the information pamphlet I was given about the mountain) - I can’t confirm this, as the area was fairly significantly under snow, and counting steps would have been way too much effort on top of just getting up them! As it turned out, I only just made it to the top - the steepness and difficulty of staying stable moving up snow covered stone steps almost made me turn back, but I managed to push onwards and made it.\\n\\nThe whole area is covered in huge cedar trees, and even with the snow cover it all looked really stunning! During the warmer months when there would be more greenery and easier hiking, it would be very impressive I’m sure.\\n\\nAt the top there were some decent views of the surrounds, though a bit blocked by trees. And there is a large shrine as well, that I imagine sees many visitors in the warmer months.\\n\\nThankfully the return trip was much easier despite the snow - getting foot holds was a lot easier when being able to lean a little back, and lead with my heels into the snowy steps.\\n\\nOnce I arrived back at the accommodation, the male host met me and was keen to hear if I made it, and how the snow was. He mentioned this has been a much warmer winter than normal, with less than half the snow they would normally see.\\n\\nDinner was at 6:30 and provided by the hosts. As I was the only one staying for the night, I could pick my time and had the dining area to myself. The meal was amazing! So much food, all very tasty, and immaculately presented! I tried to eat as much as I could, so as to not let any go to waste. I couldn’t quite get there, but put in a pretty good effort. When finished, I headed for my room, and thankfully caught their attention with my footsteps, resulting in a bit of a chat again. This gave me the chance to express my gratitude for the meal in English amd Japanese (one of the few words I know - “oishi” meaning “delicious!”). They both seemed quite happy, and after chatting a little again about my hike, I was able to prepare for a quiet night in my room, after a shower and bath (Japanese style).\\n\\nA long start to the day, but I’m very happy I managed to complete the hike, and don’t think I could have picked a better place to stay for the night!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DUp49uM-thUT_xtjXi2799GLqvutMuGc?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PTseLkmu9y6zo3Kf1HAIxiR0wjyMRhBg?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AZBFXZXQTy8U1SKI4JIJ5gBaXUOaxpJS?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qVQlHsfpaGv9Oqa_H65D5qG_KVkkZDGG?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QcnFGqbFX11UkDlllLAc-UA6LzM7OHIA?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dHClIPNItG8JvKhhSbVK91S5FKvQisXL?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n0io5LFgFUCZZdSyuEauB7-5PQElNsP7?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iYQtDRGJe5ExwpADy2yd73CoOeZVYPNT?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13weMhA_lqxiLWP6hKOj5J4sk0JAtqbuy?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1c4Ev_iBMmdyZiqaUhMEBanPQinJonI9u?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1POcjEgygJ8-I5zzDJQzCXASivnRPa1mV?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PQTIhFRK0oj3qN2w-MZK0PdQLJjNXzTx?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ppt42Pip_iMRVMAxFQ0JIK_d1rAhY4X4?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aCGTzW8PFAkn9Qr94U9zlSY1yo9u8VeC?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1U9DmJ7Hz1WQbSqXzsSgc0nTNM1mYrJFZ?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1P8z-XfGOSiRI_TpauGb1hQOO5tip1pGg?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1c_5M7B9VPPpJrZMyzJy60JSE-UcMzPeB?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1z49tZtCpabgo86r3Ylu7tQgdnHIEp8Ci?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rN2VZMAmKvJTI7UKDmsQ1bv18XVMnmBn?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11rN0DUXbLHnPRe6q1TXYeR6G0CR4SByW?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1g_lZJhs60gH7NMc61joMGurzQoEBYDQJ?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/188aRnOBNrBA8Akv87KeEXN1r09-Tfhbr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f_3y_4D9LSnSy883FspK0E2_Ygdn89O3?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1C4oQCx5yFwjxg2rj1YrdrMsHMnCSib2p?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18lwr2uW_-1UGOTqQ7Tq7JElZO2gUJW5g?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fNR6WgDIn93aLBZlRTzkxWv6Iv7zhCSV?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NquI-BG91zZ0tCBwKuepHL0Bg41fcXgv?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

This was actually the fastest way by many hours (trains would run so infrequently that there would be long transfer waits), so time for something abit different!\\n\\nAs it turned out, riding the bus was quite enjoyable. The roads were all smooth and comfortable, even through all the mountains, and the views were quite remarkable! A decent amount of snow, plenty of bare trees, and a few frozen rivers / lakes. It really was a nice surprise of a journey to my next stop.\\n\\nActually riding the bus was easy enough, though I did forget to collect a ticket on entering the bus (should have not been first…), which resulted in a friendly person alerting me and helping sort it out haha!\\n\\nOnce I arrived in Yamagata city, I left my luggage at the hotel (check in was somewhat later) and grabbed some lunch.\\n\\nI had decided today would be the day to get to Ginzan onsen - I had the time, and knew it would be a little trickier of a trip than others, so wanted to get on with it haha. This involved a train ride and a bus ride, though the bus was a little more challenging to sort out as the stops and signs outside had no English this time. Using some online help (and paying attention to the crowds), I figured out the right bus and made it there.\\n\\nGinzan onsen is a hot spring town built around an old silver mine (the name is literally translated to “silver mountain hot spring”), but is now a tourist spot for sightseeing during the day, and hot spring / inn stays during the night.\\n\\nThe small town is unique and impressive enough during day time, but it really comes to life at night (I stayed until the last bus back to the station at 6:20pm) - as the sunsets, all the ryokan and restaurants light up, and guests staying in the town start to emerge to enjoy the atmosphere. It reminded me so much of “Spirited Away” that I assume this sort of place had to be some kind of inspiration for the movie.\\n\\nGetting back to the station was interesting as well! There were 2 busses on the way, so I assumed that would be the case on the way back, but I was conscious that they could be busy, so I got to the bus stop to line up a little early. This was a good choice! The queue was already long, and in the end, I was on the second bus, and some people were left to find their own way back (probably by taxi)! This all meant the bus was a bit late, which meant I missed the train I was hoping to catch, putting me onto a later local train back to Yamagata! This was all fine, just unplanned and slightly longer than I had hoped.\\n\\nStill, I’m glad I got out to Ginzan, and today as well - tomorrow will be much less activity for a nice change!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RedUFsA30AEGI1Ep9yELnmcPXUe7i7cC?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n1vj9L7pQjZ0YjQlz1y1h9jp8xjRkyBG?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FptkdhnW_pscgydVWyc6pjet6Gm_FA7v?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lIasK0UZt7phTWW1J9i8rKdEI5w-xVF1?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JEjrpYiaCcAfCpD-fo-Ljmcu-J5h-cp5?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/102YrO_RIXTtFwPypLDZjOiBLV6qEL_BY?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F-aFOQ_U6EwE7YFKPBRIUJcvgL-PLfsO?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1z-Tq5D_TN0q1gCu7RyCni3WDYK4uSims?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1arXZt4lf75KPbK1p2wgdbsQMYedDZTCn?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KnOtPgehBFP9aohr7F0UWVBoUaTZnfrN?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Dg4t793JPpDUQz7fHsYyZ4TiS2zUKF39?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YPmZkMiO5Ugm842dRiF0dn56kVK0ALvt?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1l0IpinLQ9T9aJpEB4-T7q7aaGqt-TL1l?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BTvAr-413T6Yt9jOXx3BHWka2aT1mPKj?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13kYDlHXScQvRDIjzsa7Pjpq73UkQ1IJD?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DRVjIOHoCDu4nKsi3swTiSG6khFL98vJ?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EARduWYXn3YDQICrqL1GBKC8cLIgk_G-?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XYqBOefKz3jcrjWa9XiNjyq_xhNYjVia?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wC6-agW1GPNvBzIKzmlzpO1tZRa7j_51?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14O3b65aibBDcUJ4M48VzWqOLFGxTgGrx?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19AVFKvRTw5F-kQMEr-3fZzuLEWjQAXCT?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11oaB4P0ePYAmmLEOWTZnpxdEv_uGFL0H?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1idxXveMhm8kZRMwO6x64wkZPccTWQSXV?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r01XsSspkRSVf7UgizDNRgUF_yrXgK_V?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cAdoOB28zWbR9Io2aVdAKU-eYC5l_yPp?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i0MXKZyC08yrv4oEutWXx1omhUtivSF6?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CBokphd8qbriIaMfzHc1-Z3d1YxqBYo8?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

Though these weren’t covered in snow thankfully). The entire hike to the main grounds had stone statues and carved rocks lining the path. The sheer number of “things” scattered about made the hike really unique and interesting, and that was on top of the beautiful natural setting all around - large cedar trees and moss covered rocks everywhere.\\n\\nThe gate to the main temple complex marks about 2/3 of the steps throughout the whole area, which branches out a little after the gate. It’s not huge, but definitely larger than I expected for the location!\\n\\nThe buildings were mostly fairly typical, but the location and the views made the whole experience much more interesting.

They were neatly presented with ponds and water flowing, continued up the mountainside to give excellent views over the town and ocean, and had plum blossoms of various colours in a pretty good state of bloom! I hadn’t expected to see any blossoms on the trip (I didn’t realise plum blossoms were a thing and when they bloom), so this was amazing to see! Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed Hasedera!\\n\\nThe great Buddha at Kotoku-in was the next destination not too far away. After the impressive display at Hasedera, the grounds at Kotoku-in were a little underwhelming, but the giant Buddha was incredible to see. It’s hard to comprehend how such a large structure was made so long ago and continues to stand. Going inside gave a good look at the processes used to make it, which just adds to the impressiveness!\\n\\nTo finish the day I followed a major hiking path from nearby the giant Buddha back towards the station. This was a decent hike that took me past a few small monuments along the way, but the real highlight was at the end of the hike, just before I reached the roads back to the station. I visited Zeniarai Benten and really enjoyed the atmosphere of relaxation. The entrance was a cave carved out of part of the rock surrounding the shrine complex. Once inside, everything was neat and a bit more compact than normal, which added a “cosy” sort of feel to the place. Plenty of people were visiting as well, many happily sitting on seats in the middle of the complex, chatting or eating some snacks. The place looked great, was in a very unique location, and had an excellent atmosphere! A great way to round out the day in Kamakura.\\n\\nFrom there it was an easy walk through a park area to the station, and back to the house.\\n\\nAfter a slightly early dinner tonight, Tristan and I went to the bath house again, and this was almost as enjoyable as the first time - “almost” because at the end the machine for water and green tea wasn’t working ☹️.

The main 2 trains to Takayama totalled about 4.5 hours, plus there was a little time transferring and getting to the Shinkansen in Tokyo.\\n\\nThankfully once I arrived I was able to check in to my hotel early and drop my luggage before heading to the historic district and Shiroyama park, which is where the Takayama castle ruins are. Also, it was snowing a little in town for the whole afternoon!\\n\\nWalking to the historic district I spotted a lot of restaurants advertising beef - I think the Hida region is maybe known for their quality beef? The historic district itself was very neat and interesting - a narrow street lined with old style buildings and drains down below, meaning each shop had a little bridge leading inside. Lots of food and souvenier shops, but they all looked really nice with the traditional facades and styling.\\n\\nNext was Shiroyama park, which is a sort of walking trail park with a few monuments scattered around, and a couple of areas where foundation / ruins of the old castle can be found. I enjoyed walking through here with the snow everywhere and very few other people around. At one point I reached a monument (which kind of act like guideposts around the trails), stopped to take a photo, and realised it was completely silent. I’ve only had that experience once before that I can remember (on the side of a mountain when snowboarding in NZ), so I enjoyed that for a moment before continuing. The top of the park / hill gave some decent views of the area through the trees as well.\\n\\nBack to the hotel, I decided to try and have a hot bath in a private onsen that is on the top floor of the hotel. Luckily I was able to after a 5 or so minute wait, and it was worth it! Not as extravagent as the bath house, but with an excellent view looking over the city and mountains, and the privacy to relax and just soak it in.\\n\\nDinner was chicken curry, naan, salad, and a drink from a small Indian Nepalese restaurant not too far from the train station. This was fantastically delicious and a great variation from Japaneae food all the time 😉.

A very thick piece of toast with butter and strawberry jam, and coffee. This was nice to have - I haven’t eaten toast since I arrived haha.\\n\\nAfter checking out of the hotel, I walked to the Hida folk village - an “open air museum” showcasing traditional buildings, tools, and general way of life for people in the region from many centuries ago.\\n\\nThis place was very interesting! Really unique things on display inside many of the buildings, and the buildings themselves with various roofing materials and styles. Was a relaxed way to learn a bit more about how things worked in the region a long time ago, before modern conveniences.\\n\\nOnce I finished at the folk village, I had enough time to revisit the historic district to see how it looked without snow. I enjoyed the walk through the street again, but I think the snow made for a more novel experience.\\n\\nThe whole afternoon was travelling to Kyoto, and this took longer than anticipated due to train delays in the first leg which made me have to catch a later Shinkansen for the second leg. Still, not a big problem, just meant a little more time travelling than expected!\\n\\nDinner was from a small restaurant not too far from the hotel. I had a pork cutlet with miso sauce set (with rice, miso soup, tofu, and shredded cabbage). This was really tasty, well-priced, and fresh! Ordering was done with a vending machine (thankfully with pictures for all the menu options), then the staff would take a piece of the receipt for the kitchen, and use the other part to identify you when your food is ready! It’s a neat system that works well and gave me no trouble.

The town sits at the base of a temple complex that stretches up the mountain from the valley, and back down the other side to the town of Kibune.\\n\\nThe stream of buildings and smaller structures along the path were pretty impressive, mostly for the number of them, and their location up the zigzagging mountain trail.\\n\\nThankfully the hike was a little easier compared to others I have done so far! It was still a lengthy hike, taking an hour and a half from valley to valley, but there were some good views along the way. I even got a good view of a helicopter carrying away cut down trees from the side of a mountain across the valley!\\n\\nArriving in Kibune, straight away there was a neat mid-sized shrine that looked nice and tidy, and had a number of gates lining the short path to it. With the surrounding mountainside forest, it made for a very nice end to the hike.\\n\\nNext I walked through the village to reach an underwhelming shrine at the top. What wasn’t underwhelming though, was the town itself - some really beautiful old buildings with some of the best facade / entrances I’ve seen so far. Even better was the river running behind one side’s buildings - this river was flowing well and was setup in a way that there were frequently drops and rocks making it look great, but even more impressive is the thought that during summer the restaurants along the river put floors and rooves over it and serve customers lunch and dinner in the cool!

Beyond that though, they aren’t overly remarkable, at least during winter.\\n\\nLunch ended up being at a really nice tonkatsu restaurant. Similar to dinner last night, but this time the pork cutlet was in a sweet soy broth with egg and shallots, making for a fairly different meal, but delicious all the same!\\n\\nWith lunch done, I made my way to Fushimi Inari Taisha, famous for its many rows of thousands of shrine gates leading around the complex. This place was enormous - the initial area is reasonably large, but the further you travel into the mountains behind the entrance, the more impressive it becomes. So many torii. Just everywhere! There are so many that there are occassionally huge clusters of them setup as their own shrines along the paths! Hiking up many more steps, eventually I reached the main viewing area which gives some pretty impressive views looking out over Kyoto.\\n\\nUnsurprisingly, this was the place I saw the highest percentage of tourists so far - the place was busy enough, though not too bad, and it was kind of nice to hear some English for a bit haha. Until I heard some whingey girls being overly dramatic about the hike. Then I was happy to leave the area and not be surrounded by as many English speakers again haha.\\n\\nHaving done many kilometers of walking for the day, with a significant percent of those hiking up and down mountains, I was happy to call it there, and headed back down to the train station and back to the hotel to rest!\\n\\nLots of walking and hiking, but the scenery was well worth it!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17Fknhtdj7FLaO1B6OCoD1NJtvSBXxsgk?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YH22oZiM1aLnU-LQF7Ckotf16XeVgrbD?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VV21Yzdfs2LYr5_bGF4G8UiRrGcwZIbz?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r1vb9rhSJp6Xzddsx6izyf8USAHcQK-d?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vmbj5S2DOsfnfe59s0wjh5jGJ66Lracp?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bqfoNeUD1HBX4TmEXOxIa3-yxDVeZObD?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11k-jkjdvGuVFql_UPw0cXgVvUmQ2D26J?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hL48iIwTRchIKRzgMrlPgx9aqxjHxQqt?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DkisS6YZPQAR2XfQTLPCS36mErutNDzl?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B98sS6BY6_MuyCdfJqYcOTb-ROKRuU_a?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11StnnkrTsaQtdcHvNBYd3cHH6eWqCpth?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16jKin_B5JJrMwZeMa5s9KV4ZSoHleSv9?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1A9nVEcDOEnuZ-G2lQE4Fi34iqC0tDzrq?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ve0FJOGyrFrhiqrHfMG7JL4vCs6-qOHC?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yaODBuFWtFycXjOypf6QUBrhDa2ffjOE?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/151uZ1meABJVrhGr07MVs725LH5ZksxJj?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hkoIV_lbInepGSKIQp6znN1eaSrD8fnm?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BmhWt3358EvCd_qu2FKjcgT2hoo0r8La?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MdAGSCnWajy3Goym2AcVCLNJNenH9nCH?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-qBp2DSk0dthzQYXlMg6t81zWINkCo7W?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IR9pv1ppp3MSPC8AKc0UE7V1D96MnpUE?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hyQOeqoQXdh1DYgzEBsHl3JWLZyAJNYx?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Hh2aOM1JqM_YrVsG8GME-9DLp3tuoMnv?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dLu2kcGAJ0Cg0qQo93eyZRsafn0fcoLh?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SYG02QtAM8t-lUuttdhjoUZM2-DGWeFY?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1V9ThqVhoekHy9FkRUr0SobkfgKiwJf5A?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lh7MoYI1umI13q7LYMh5MrQyIhU-9s7N?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

There is only one main building once you reach the top where the monkeys live, and that is used for visitors to feed monkeys if they want - the monkeys are free to roam around the mountainside, and people just visit them in their natural habitat. It was a really nice change to the usual enclosure-based “zoo” type experience, which meant you got to see families of monkeys playing and scampering about, and others cleaning each other, and others being inquisative of the people. I really did enjoy spending time watching them! Also the view was pretty fantastic!\\n\\nSince I was nearby, I wanted to go to the bamboo grove next, to see if it was as impressive as I remembered it. This was about 10 mins or so from the entrance to the monkey park, and when I arrived, I was a bit disappointed because of the crowds. The grove itself was still just as nice to see (it was even a little more impressive with more daylight), but with all the people visiting and stopping to take photos all over the path, it didn’t have the same impact as last time. Also, there were now signs scattered about saying not to sit and lean and park bikes along the path, which also kinda ruined the feel. I don’t recall that from last time, so I suspect the popularity of the place has boomed and these measures have been put in place to try and keep it managable.\\n\\nEven though the bamboo grove wasn’t as enjoyable of an experience as I had hoped, it was still decent, and the monkey park more than made up for it!\\n\\nThe afternoon is in the next post!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dpqJE9QcjO2tBtKwKefZ-KJqE7yfHu1j?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a9hQ5lHfDfHniSIxk2g3Ey2qNivoQAHv?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nFf69G4pLcdoOR9yaIISV1KyerYhaRDc?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gE8jpE22m_DU1v47JdyFrg9rQcc90xf3?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1T5iqaHT_a9byFT9GcvFXTjaVrAhGfKud?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MzQ5DB3BHZM-HXnnUleGJQdRGB3A87FM?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13JCBiZ1kqGrdbBNjwERhdrV4nM5yjBsr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F5pJpPYBldB0DTR79TkpZmDvDWY9rfPF?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zgK5E9VClXJw2KPYtdvaWjrJYb11xMHy?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13NyGx9jUCQ_ekvUZIA5Ky6cJVHI6llfT?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sNeeqDuJZ2kZpoHI03zuqi6y3d0X91Ug?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1b-w8MNMjxgg1WC1FNIaEnz497_a8sDEO?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/112yG1HCMU87rTrepzEiptSayjB9tdsPY?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WUWl4FgfsajdHl_fvcYX_is9ZodemT3u?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11BP0hPhnsuJGpe22NONPMWsl-Tm1XyQ-?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R98duDl1RoTA0jlUMDsjcLkxWhH80zSS?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14D9AXGEh5JB6xeXbX9NHnFXdFKGgYfeE?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jjN5iB4xoAyLRulsIFNxwCd258Dp4vdi?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13KaQg2ACjZS-MSYSi7inq15d_zXmPylJ?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Y2zhIRRc2NuqHQU4s-JdrDKRiapTOjky?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QdtVyISd23e2Dk_mPZpu8HMAq-3Tnp3L?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XBVZViw34LAeeHej6IbXGsm24gSuKwZ3?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/182Bechb07S7rXe62uns006nvmH1-aM8L?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1umSYGzEGC3o4BGOFCk8yT6OLKt0cbpfL?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1u54hYkO0lQToa1P-qxcXMPS49PjDJr9D?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bLrwmmOJDunG31j_5BHRWH9xoWgGgk2p?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-qJHDDF8xIaELF3ExzuXo_R0RKz_pwQR?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

I wanted to check this place out because I had read it has lots of plum blossom trees, and since they have been starting to bloom while I’ve been in the country, I thought it might be a good place to see them!\\n\\nAs it turns out, there is a whole garden filled with many varieties of plum blossoms, but I was about a week early - next weekend was advertised for a festival (I think). It looked like the trees were maybe half in bloom, which was still an impressive sight! I opted not to bother with the garden though (1000 yen entrance fee was too steep), and instead admirred the blossoms in the free grounds, and from a distance in the garden. Still, it gave a good idea of how extraordinary the flowers must look when they are all out in bloom.\\n\\nNext, it was only a few more bus stops to Kinkaku-ji (the gold pavilion), which I don’t think I had been to before. This place was busy, but nicely laid out that things were still orderly. The main building was very impressive and unique, and I particularly liked how the gardens and pond adjoining the building seemed to make it all the more interesting to see. The rest of the gardens / the walk through the area was nice and straight forward.\\n\\nLastly I wanted to get back to Kiyomizu dera, mostly because it was free, and reconstruction work had finished on it. The shopping street leading to the entrance was pretty busy, but that gave the place a fun energy - plenty of people browsing shops and trying local snacks and treats. The temple complex itself was more impressive than I remember, possibly because the sun was out this time, and so were some blossoms! Bright orange / red buildings, and a few plum blossoms out made for quite a striking place to visit, but also the grounds were immaculate and a bit less rough compared to others I had visited so far. It’s not surprising why so many people visit this temple, and it’s also a place I didn’t mind seeing a lot of people - it felt appropriately lively 🙂.\\n\\nDinner was at the same place I ate from 2 nights ago, because I wanted to try the fried ginger pork. This was tasty again, though I think I preferred the katsu I had the first time!

This was a nice salad, bread, and croissant buffet, with the choice of eggs and ham or eggs and sausage to go with it.\\n\\nDuring check out I organised to have my main luggage delivered to my hotel in Imabari, which was an easy service to organise thanks to the frequency of this request meaning hotels have systems in place to do this.\\n\\nNext I picked up the rental bike a few minutes away - this was also easy enough due to the number of people doing this (this cycle route is becoming popular among locals and tourists). Finally I caught the ferry to the start point of the ride and got going!\\n\\nAbout 1km in while I was figuring out the gear situation on the bike, the chain fell off… There were 2 sets of gears, so I decided I would sit in the middle for the set with only 3 gears (I think this one was a bit sloppy and didn’t want the hassle of dealing with it more than once), but thankfully the other set (with 6-8 gears I think) was more robust. After getting grease all over my hands while getting the chain back on, I was on my way haha.\\n\\nThe rest of the ride was less eventful (thankfully), with the main standouts being the scenery - the Seto inland sea really is quite a remarkable and interesting place to see. So many islands scattered about, with the main ones along the route being visited via the 6 bridges connecting them. The hill climbs to these bridges were a little challenging, but still not too bad - I only walked 2 times through the entire ride, and one of those was a regular hill, not up to a bridge. The nice thing about those climbs though, was that you would always get some incredible views of the sea, islands, and bridge! There were plenty of rest areas along the route, so stopping to rest briefly and admire the sights was easy.\\n\\nLunch was half way at the “cyclist’s sanctuary” - a pit stop kind of area with a couple of take out places, one restaurant, vending machines for drinks, toilets, and some great views (it was on the water).\\n\\nThe second half was a bit more challenging, probably because of the building exhaustion of my legs, but there were enough milestones along the way to keep me focused and pushing forward. Then the final bridge… This thing was incredible! Over 4km long, it gave plenty of opportunity to look out over the sea and islands below. Once I cleared it, the rest was pretty much downhill, and I excitedly made my way to the rental bike drop off point.\\n\\nFrom there it was a short walk to my hotel for the night, which had already received my luggage when I checked in! Things were very smooth, and I was able to relax for the rest of the day - long showers and watching some TV from my phone!\\n\\nDinner was a Chinese chicken dish before I went and grabbed some dessert and a drink (cheaper from a convenience store)!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17yTYq6FtvMkcQw2A2ANpoUqJ4ZSEiolu?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ItKwVwfFh_ORdZoV7rG96wfSWJlVvYfS?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gzuW9RoYXNK8rrVGO2aaqgo4kf1LqoC3?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jp9y95iyVWyHEiUf0RnCXZPbJ6EBelEo?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jKX1CzvjnU30ZTcxCSlyoJcXdAExl3Sk?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19--49r4SjzWznTb9eY0RYBo9OcjKXMiG?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pVnWj3w-XTa9YTRDD2M5FTlnY3z2fLkZ?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1etTzK2cOQf2ZVRLsKP7wiBcItDQ0BngS?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1179plvFM6sLAlvpd_Ir4QPgenWjLxH4K?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aWycF1H_WkPilQWCGEdku24BKtv4UjEg?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CC1vVMOe_YJqJSjdUx6Af_bYSJZteBEK?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aiVFv_eNJ_MoYoq1RPUVwlHOTlKzrCP7?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZN_LPNZJpS_0UuDwS7SBEEvXs8oq9ZXa?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TF0IBnkb704dR_XErAEOyQL4_mgibL3c?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xyQKNDvCCKZy820zEGRA_CekvsewuSbI?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wVpuPVY_qXH_pGdHj6k1FhUbHF8arucc?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XdEm9nXqWMDUpieaP582472bv4h98U1Z?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13wjjw45Dy7z3DMBqr0ptU6DLk0GvsH3u?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19pm59r3oxKtlOfhOQFxPrIluORMkXMYn?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JeNzD59qftX450TJ3elTg1Qnu8Sv6a8M?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uE45tP9tUgXJtiazHUz1cZgiHmELmxcw?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16BVh4y6iSEAxFvQiCpgvjDdSmAdwf5EE?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1z_5D3CutNr98w5r9oN5XOfijOsae9j0V?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KY3mx54tttsJL7pWbKGS2A2bQXcXMMGM?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10jz7uX8-f9fDuvb7E-9hBbZYorSFSY7d?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12LP5B7OALuhOXivuQk9ALMQkOup745Wi?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uCjqLBntlIbDcbOmkBk_Woyy150fapdG?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

Travel time was similar, but involved a lot less effort, and I was happy to have a quieter and cheaper day at the expense of seeing some new areas.\\n\\nThe first train ride took me along the north coast of Shikoku, then over the sea again (at a different, very long bridge). This made for some neat sights to see, so it wasn’t all about being lazy in the end!\\n\\nOnce in Hiroshima, I made my way straight to Miyajima island so I could check in and walk around the island before everything shut. Unfortunately the “floating” shrine gate (“torii”) and the ropeway to the top of Mt Misen were both undergoing maintenance, so that reduced the sights to see and things to do a bit. Walking about and experiencing the island was still great though - the number of snack food stores is incredible for the size of the place (lots of locals and foreign tourists visit each day), and seeing the variety of things on offer was fun!\\n\\nAfter the day visitors had left and the majority of shops shut, I went to find a restaurant for dinner. I thought I might be able to try okonomiyaki tonight, but the main place in town selling it had an hour wait (which I knew thanks to a kind patron who translated the owner’s information as I walked in).

Initial signs were very positive! The staff were very friendly and spoke pretty good English as well.\\n\\nOnce that was sorted, I headed in to Hiroshima for the day. First stop was the A-Bomb Dome and surrounding peace park area. It was pretty interesting to see the structure look exactly as I remember it from all those years ago, and I’m pretty sure some of the photos I nabbed will be almost identical as a result. Reading about it, there have been a number of preservation works done on the structure to try to keep it looking like it did after the blast.\\n\\nThe rest of the peace park area was also how I remember it - I suspect the gravity of the location has meant the memories will always be there for me.\\n\\nThe final stop in the area was the museum. As expected, this place was very sombre and confronting. The photos and artworks in particular tell a heartwrenching story, especially combined with the context behind them. Still, being able to follow the timeline of events before and after the bomb was fascinating. I think this was the biggest take away for me - seeing how escalating international conflict during WWII resulted in the decision that using atomic bombs on 2 cities was the “best” option. It was hard not to see how that line of thinking has likely existed in some form ever since, and probably before as well. Ultimately though, the overwhelming message the museum presents is one of peace and harmony, and seeing how the city of Hiroshima thrives these days, it’s definitely a better take away than the alternative.\\n\\nI wanted to follow the museum visit up with a more positive experience - one that made me smile and enjoy the pleasures of life 🙂.\\n\\nThis meant finding Okonomimura, or “okonomiyaki village.” Three floors of small okonomiyaki bars, all with their own slight variations on the Hiroshima style of the well-known dish. I’ve never had it before, and now that I have, I’m disappointed I haven’t eaten more of it - for such a simple dish, it was incredibly tasty and fun to watch it being prepared! I suspect I might try Osaka style before I leave there…\\n\\nLast for the day was Shukkeien, a “shrunken” style garden. This was a nice relaxing place to visit, and showed off some really interestingly design landscape and trees. Finding out about the reason for certain elements existing in the garden was neat, and showed how this sort of garden has so many considerations given to it - most things have a place and reason for being where they are. For example, many of the elements of this garden were intended to represent local important natural landmarks, or historically valued concepts in Japanese culture. Also, there was a plum blossom grove woth many trees partially in bloom! For sure this garden was worth the cheap entrance fee, and it ended up being a rather unique experience to add to my trip!\\n\\nFrom there it was back to Miyajima island for a relaxed afternoon looking out over the water from a coffee shop, then enjoying the accommodation and dinner for the night!\\n\\nFollowing on from the initial experience at the accommodation for the night, check in was a totally new level - they called a staff member to show me to my room, who then proceeded to explain using the facilities in the ryokan, and brought in tea shortly after, then explained how to wear a yukata and how to use the room equipment.\\n\\nSee the next post for dinner onwards!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j11rxYuznR4PPXdM2jU05xQgtqjk2efk?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/198C1sX0kGynNgUMryLYhkDrD4vxd5m3l?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WWNWaT8HrC0gQruhkMvUfMra9pyGBufr?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11Omwt5bLAEn6WwBnMoCjTE1n48xh_Slu?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DljYAjUtQoUpFPd5PJcEq6qD0imOgl7f?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UfRY7q1XhZziDuQZiXE2VunkfxXkuQSS?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iAHrtDBa-OYs7TNoAfOTXflCVs5rtBLW?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VE56a7WEsv7lWYB7wDIuOYHcY160OXSB?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Wp50xi4f7BuqHR1cdwcE1IEE__zJyAgf?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jiMxUqHUoP6ODumnoje6s6zbPBXd4w7E?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m-DLItRr7hMcZEqsZYSDJ2iyE8Xuahc9?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yVVMZ1_81Se5MyKtfx0vnzwVpp9xrCM0?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1u2wFLSqKoTLpsS3Ivkg7MPlmseXtPtng?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tNGyFvchfjxD0DIn3ljn3jRDBxidpE-a?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lC_h6ezE18OLhSEZi-kyrFMLeC5dnMMV?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Xr7wd7ma5NT0soXdYNardT5aozjtu_YS?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RiiQiMrZPDEw-ZLrfnVQZigtVu7sd4Lc?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HwCp-DFQRnzBHEvZLiaySp6Z0t55eB_q?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1G_3i-IsuKnIl2tESy0MLvSZFyhm1wH_z?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VdcPUctTNFzS0wuwarraFy-0iKWOnado?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mBPZabvq6xa7C4mZWLohQEzHT3wzSr6o?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hNZAr1e_atw0BJcgcLZZXUGEPSYljo_P?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1h_ILgxi8BxKbPOJ3kvZSQPrQpl9HInxH?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16TV7p0CiLliItnVUMh0jApL36Kjnu9pF?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11uRnow9ixJ_2IZNb5hQzDabLd_p8aiWv?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WABv5T3WRVI7rLE55vKfQXpcrgYo7vvs?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fkx3X1EXtEKLQ5w4akmmf8tFEe4Li7At?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

I had forgotten how impressive the castle and grounds are! The whole area is quite large, with winding pathways intended to funnel attackers through a path to make defense easier. Then there is the main keep - so many floors, with narrow and steep stairs between them, especially as you get to the last few. It really was staggering to see again, and to think it was originally built centuries ago.\\n\\nOnce I had finished exploring the castle, I continued on to Osaka. The accommodation for the night was comfortable, though nothing particularly fancy really.\\n\\nIn the evening I went to check out Dotonbori, a famous shopping / restaurant street, and grabbed some Osaka style okonomiyaki for dinner. I think I preferred this type - it held together a bit better which made for easier eating.\\n\\nTo finish the night off, I visited the Space Station bar and had a good time enjoying a couple game themed drinks and chatting to various people who were there.

We managed to play a bit here and there throughout my visit, so it was nice to have one last session.\\n\\nNext we walked to and around a bit of Hikarigaoka park (their local large one) again, and even found a small plum blossom grove that he didn't know was there! This was a nice relaxing way to spend some time and just chat.\\n\\nAfter that, it was getting close to lunch (at least for an early-ish lunch), so I made sure I had everything and we headed out for the rest of the day. We went to Saizeriya, an Italian restaurant where we had plenty of time and space to chat and enjoy some pizzas and drink bar.\\n\\nWith lunch over, we headed for Ginza, an area I can't remember seeing on any trip before. This is the \\\"up-market\\\" area of Tokyo, with high-end shops and cars everywhere! We really just saw the area and the shops, and looked through the Sony showroom store - nothing particularly picturesque, but it was still fun to see all the crazy expensive places, and multiple Ferraris, Porches, and even a Lamborghini or 2 haha.\\n\\nThe last thing we had a bit of time for was walking to the Tokyo station area (where I needed to catch my train from), and doing some train watching before grabbing a coffee to finish up. We went to a 6th floor observation rooftop area that overlooks Tokyo station's tracks, which was interesting to see - so many trains run so frequently, including the Shinkansen!\\n\\nAnd then it was time to leave. We said our farewells at the station and parted ways. The train ride to the airport was a little eventful - we had the emergency brakes activate and a 10 minute delay caused by a \\\"safety check\\\" (which was only communicated in English once we started moving properly again). My guess is there was some automated safeguard kicked in as a response to a false alarm fault. Still got to the airport with plenty of time, and not having to check luggage meant I could skip the queue and get through easily!\\n\\nThe flight home was pretty poor unfortunately - the plane was pretty close to full, so things were cramped, and I was in the middle seat between 2 people who weren't that respectful of the limited space available. At least the flight was 50 minutes shorter than scheduled!\\n\\nStill, the trip ended up being a very enjoyable and interesting one, and seeing Tristan and Naoko again, and for a good amount of time was fantastic! Definitely will be memories I'll hold onto for many years to come!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vqy_tA2M_90iR2hs1rLbrB-CIF62AO41?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1k6vQ4rPerlYI1W2GVfCcCpHKVNsF9kVZ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UGUsrwCq6yrPndH4WYNFRdDq2oVbqcy7?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rphL6h21lgk4QOlaAFMYsBCJXAkKDKb6?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mtDmR9GNQcjSMHKqddA0MDvu4fct0Luc?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19puICfE9Gu53_102nXiniK1J5vIOXZg9?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1p3JyJWeSSkFxUXncp4GuDR4362UsckbM?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sQhD1VrfeVq0vwSIDb9303h7weyhymvc?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uFtfMwbMVMU88Qgvp13UO2EXMM0xg46c?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1A9Xhvv3zNFRIEHC8peWdLQJVR5sxebQp?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KY9SgVunef7wsCoZu5WSXGifqJBVu80O?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nrGMKKybWE07r4Vio5-dleCbvCY6HeL3?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gU2pZQGeRt-1wGPudBLBAygNZqkV11nr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bz0WQsJY-rnzbG91cCxktJMRD5wv0jyD?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aqX3WSnIQH92fK7Ba8vfWwhw_D2WvosK?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>
