Our guide explained many students go there to pray for success in their academic endeavours. \\n\\nThe grounds were quite expansive, with a great combination of shrine structures and nature - ponds, unique bridges, and forest with some really impressive trees. I really liked the variety of trees and how the shrine felt like it was made to co-exist with the environment.\\n\\nAfter exploring the shrine, we had time to check out the shops in the street leading up to it. We picked up some souvenirs, and enjoyed a coffee, gelato, and chat with some others in our tour group.\\n\\nFor the afternoon, we went to a large-ish shopping mall in the city. There was a pretty solid looking tempura restaurant, so we decided to give it a go since we hadn't tried it yet. Sat at the bar, the food we ordered from the vending machine outside was brought over as it was ready. Everything tasted excellent! The experience was great, and everyone enjoyed the food, as well as seeing the process of it being made for us.\\n\\nAs we got closer to the evening, it was time to be taken to the ferry terminal where we would sleep overnight and find ourselves in Osaka the next morning!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jFScViDtRf0zHF52AkMWVVbrZrKRSlog?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m1qiuYzUEwMAq31AX7BUPrdGxZ1wtm9U?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IRtqi1CrM6hdEVHWXe1zE1Eyd7ZGtWiB?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1D_ZZo7rvBKjZJArvzASimfn1hLVgm3Eo?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/107SxnOd6BuODM1aurHkPyOzM4l7Bv_1e?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DH2AJhsMaYfhC3tRGLtLWCRDvEXZAU_z?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wUcVmkhdDHx7ZV4D4gAij7PCDus-iLW1?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wCdlGd6ne8B7if-ytZEBBT1HUo0xQX1m?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aB0_DvH2BshZnBnXnNnX9spHkqWIGS33?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i9kgQp_8mtlHKETP90kPrd4UBNikG5cC?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OaYUDdMpsxhOvy8bzW34K2FGHzJV_AZO?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rsq1hbB1Dyi8OHc0Rsh_MzdJYB5dzqAy?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UD9OlZnwJIhGIL6lfhAZjWQuamyT68ME?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cavtr9-qhwlZzEvNuKnONu0WeBhEl5tS?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sdDBr7rk0mXHiZqdoY5C6RelQlo1JM7D?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aqRNn0HOMdPJ0v24R7cq-TG2157PRIY8?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OyctuhKVSmfGVYuVB2vMy99-L70h6v57?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_skfi7SS_iAQdbHCBZRcsW-jHcfcr8kN?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f0kJ5cC7sVh9zmh5PaXDAmtTOw2YTyj2?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1s2o62aKVQZeBgBUQZWpjnSUyCBX1aLt6?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NzRHSmwdFP-rqKxYYIeiMLYHfSw4lbPh?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vqTtE9tyqQZ0kadnvkfXa9cfPa5syZfT?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZTPNzxobRm6t76_IG2ydp0gDcgt8MK5d?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-l9Odz3WeZ94iNbB2YrQn4Q6ISxH6UAc?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yaM6C_qCZZa3Ue63PiBnPHHAHOLBAtaC?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r20ccYSgdSVzR0C3sRgT-J0Cy7MIyAH3?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hL3fQnCOmTo2jNEtEJGxh9PghEuWh8Ob?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

This was a bit of a novelty, but the tea was very nice and made for a different way to spend time at a stop along the way. The rest stop itself was modern and full of all kinds of things to see and buy.\\n\\nNext was a short steam train trip through some countryside. The steam train was neat, as were the preserved carriages we rode in. Seeing quiet countryside with tea farms and small townships was a great change of pace we all enjoyed.\\n\\nFrom there we were bussed off to another railway - this one for transport up into the mountains. The carriages were quite narrow and had wooden bench seats lining both sides with not much else to them. This was a unique experience in itself which took us through some lovely mountain landscapes. About half way through the journey we stopped while the train was quickly adjusted for the other unique aspect of the trip - it uses an alternate system to be able to climb steeper inclines up the mountain route. This resulted in a more bumpy ride, but was definitely interesting to experience!\\n\\nWe transferred to the bus, and for one final experience for the day, we stopped at an observation spot perched up one of the mountains overlooking a lake and part of the railway we had just travelled - the view from here was spectacular, and seeing the train make its way back was a really great way to round out the day.\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AbUg27y_ZggnSMit40S_dtf3NMBokPQ3?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lCa-AKisImThdjRPfTTCi1LKHzUW1j_G?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iC5faT3ohv-PaoCS9w64YZZO92ZeOCKj?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eCdRjizjry2qGR3V2fw7wdf95whHz3WH?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aY1kh2o1v1W0LK8t40bv84ZpTTgS6Xfh?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Jjq31nh4-4ywrmF_CF1nDikLQ86AFCDk?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iS2iO0-VBXfgg6eK-_AXSHZbZkb9QrTA?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ce33EWggjOQ2jhftjuZtpPUf78GndQHX?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L18uaAtBBt6iQm30cP554oqtiBVdmk73?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wb7QRKQa2F05XL3oU2p9zES29plWmYmw?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yBhkZbPQT5Fad4iX10xorw54Yg1ns8PU?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sET7NWl6GNetGUtV6DJCiIIbF9XH0Hyv?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LAi_2RSk3bSW78P6dxOsMhJSVhCzctHf?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n_cTQ-hE7czH2uQkpkvJkm_-QTaMvuGr?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1v6F0VVx58B2QGqQ9ziiOtkt3Zg_rgNj-?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16p27O_16aUiw5FQeGhK9Gc4-6W0BweBl?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dBhm1WOH0ylhQCysb_DjfPS5Tgb8wAur?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LnqHHEU2OCOiQWAPm8hqYThWuH9t_2Ib?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pbfdglcj4rxnLRVaYUmTskZbeQyg718R?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1klbbaew_HVZTfKwHL6z0xf2uU6nZtUTL?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZMCF3S_dqd0mOBlEiKZwGplmZN7PrpP0?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

In particular when I reached one of the temple grounds at the end of the road - there were food stalls around the entrance, and the area was lit in a way that showed off the structures and trees really well.

Afterwards we all had a go at preparing some for ourselves (just the tea making part). This was a great experience all around, and the shop and owners were great to have a chat to.\\n\\nOur next stop was a short walk away at Byōdōin temple with its Phoenix Hall. These grounds were nice, but the temple itself being around 1000 years old is hard to comprehend. Seeing the preserved artwork on the walls inside a very nicely presented temple that's that old is hard to put into words.\\n\\nThere was also a museum we walked through with artefacts associated with the temple and the beliefs surrounding it - this was also incredible to see and ponder given the age.\\n\\nNext we were back into Kyoto, straight to Arashiyama bamboo forest. Unfortunately this place is overrun by tourism now, but still is a neat experience.\\n\\nGetting out of the main street of Arashiyama, we headed over the river to find a simple lunch before trekking up to the monkey park (see next post).

Thankfully this visit there were no construction or refurbishment works happening, so we were able to see and experience the full scale of the castle.

We did pick up some sweets from smaller shops along the way though, all of which were delicious.\\n\\nOur hotel for the night was a little out of the city center, so we explored the local shopping area nearby, grabbed a simple dinner and called it a day.\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wkqx2chppY5xQUn8iQzeea0EGKdeph70?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Yi9vPr-v888M_kR3xYOx4vsHoExSOXYu?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xOKGtL7l0cO4ndQIyVvgfI_ALqdsZp6E?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XnP1dXCgEeG3L1HcGOO5QTsEWkZDRQa_?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1T0zKV-DZI44n2bIv5cyGwvYSGMl_goe7?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wI-llh8snNKP1NkaGVDLMINXRD3Tn3rj?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JevN0miqcMZmEBNrCuc2KZT1dQ2Ma7ve?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11pcOA157oUxof2-tx9Rp0VnhxNIuZaZc?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XRB8fAMPYdUwNeK_Ke7Xs8hrh1CQ47pf?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NfximML7QFGPFI27SMBJcjO0f9NdJR_8?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OaISc0tbXQBGGQm30to8PKC00B-yDMcH?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yBG1Jrp_bdcMTrHyysnYgsuJmcbK0aF9?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DqTPAgqZGuqkknO9-mgG6PdpHvcuiNZp?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f7EPEYHzbQdKDR6-_M1YjTeHlfBi5AEo?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13HFzJqm8wtHKcY-5vmUqi0Pj8TxS6C7S?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15h0sBETVa3-41NDhz4BSb4aoeIG3Imkh?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1z9g6AZ2MzfXLiTwGBWRfFKQ08mhTB2qz?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19QP-Uhk7ivTSVr8nvE8tD2EJtWGQvaRM?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JUUAuklacZehEQBOfg9o_UatPkbeyr-F?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KBxUtvMYv0AxM_MhrWp2ZU55f1vVZOY2?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-HS1hIqWORgPlCXzMG4mBjibdQwcjEpi?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1O8GEgiM7X1j50cYpoNT7JQbe-n-a-VWE?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RayLUxP9soF1JujqSrDkxwoYhVfv8g6u?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nbv3KAlcqpQ0bTxTxUwW7TcssICDRicO?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

Around every 10km one of these towns marked a place for businesses to thrive, serving travellers passing through, and giving them a place to shelter on their journey.\\n\\nThese towns were really neat to see, with the historical buildings and streets a stark departure from the modern we have been seeing. It was a bit strange seeing most of the buildings closed and without much in the way of business, but this does make sense - the government provides funding to help the communities preserve the areas, but aside from occasional tours coming through, there isn't much in the way of customers anymore, since the routes aren't travelled much with modern infrastructure providing faster alternatives.\\n\\nIn between the 2 towns, we stopped at a mountainside rest stop for lunch. This was a relatively small rest stop, but had some amazing local produce for sale, and our lunch was a tiny steamed bun and gyoza shop which made fantastic food. The rest stop was perched on the side of the mountain looking over a valley, and made for a really nice place to enjoy a meal before we continued on.\\n\\nOur hotel tonight was in Matsumoto city, and seeing as it was the second last night of the tour, our guide suggested a group dinner out at a nearby Irish pub. Most of us went to this, and it was a great time. We had some nice food, some great drinks, and chatted for a while before settling in for the night.

There are 2 really nice options in Ueno park, so we grabbed a table where there was one free and got our drinks. This was a very nice atmosphere - the day was pleasant, and sitting in a park having a coffee, taking in the sights and reminiscing about the trip was a fantastic way to spend some of our last day.\\n\\nWe had a couple hours to explore some of the national museum, which wasn't ages, but it gave enough time to work our way through 2 buildings at a steady enough pace. Seeing and reading about the historical artefacts, and the dating of some of them was really cool - so much history captured over thousands of years, and on display. The more \\\"modern\\\" exhibits were also fascinating - the intricate details of artworks and clothing over the ages, just awesome to see in person.\\n\\nWe wrapped up with enough time to get back and have some late lunch before heading to the airport. Before our transfer at Tokyo station, we ventured outside to see the building and get a sense of the scale of the station, then we were on one last bullet train ride back to the hotel area.\\n\\nLunch was in a nice restaurant on the walk back to the hotel, then it was time to collect our luggage and wait for the bus to the airport.\\n\\nPhew! It was a very busy two-and-a-bit weeks, but definitely interesting to experience the country in this different way, and it was great to share the experience with some family this time!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tcN-XUcuVCTX9dosuZqf35gyFx5zYJll?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jxJpuU8WQy4Pkmucn3Ptc5DmiMBOEks8?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AgxAbF11xxrRTC0LlUB1lqjpz_9e9HzZ?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16WrnRFXujqeE6Py3EHDPh00X1anD3Z58?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ysCb3kKfigork8w4Bm7dOAO2iXiLKNRJ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1E1sUDwAPzZM-GX83r7wvK4HEj5ZLLQpq?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cDvoQDDvcyEugtzpX7o3z1CFDMAoYGLQ?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hucgjAyC4jIR5tCzUS6xuSq4mTNr7j5E?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12DLXmTYq5VUSbbMfKR-oorguCuVZ0FtB?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/163w1j_IwATZq-gKJDoMKfjoMb5ft4KM6?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12snRTPV4a1RiXUJrsZr9XlmZ5Z0ZLlm5?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MvuUufWeKLEVpoQy08mg49-AjKKcp1rw?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DmGZUA5J1iaNkakHtlyDpOiN13vF-zRi?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/112oFZmqzg1hafBbp3gh-Vh6R--CQ1-WF?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ujhQqFxp8X2IIPibbatnoo-mUjTY2ZcM?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cQeDWviHitzdAzdZwUGzwkFLjEX2YypX?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1P6ndh2qe6El-bvb6GnB0Q-bk1fUvFh7E?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UrPlcbOJutLQ7XWRijxTSBWIdyUJ4qnl?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YyL423gvq_aUddNmneY0BNDIkDSlqDIP?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WP74jYdMyGYNM6SbWXMVFzy5WMUAGA0V?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L-9JtqnhJBFGNrRwC_Bchz_KgNn4VqzX?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1s_h8MtSPLeErSBSwbAcOzq3bfEXZ-z2t?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dul5p8NNwSZsUayuutP6M6a_qhX_19_W?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xDrNbEjFBC6TFdJzr7xU-7HIcLVby8lL?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>
