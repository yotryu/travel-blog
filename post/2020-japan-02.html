This was mainly due to it being easily accessible on the same subway from Tristan’s place, but also because it was early and would actually be open 😉.\\n\\nIt still looks as neat and tidy as I remember it, though because I stuck around for a little while, I got to see a procession of horses from the palace walk around the grounds for a bit. I suspect this was practice or training, as they stuck to a fairly simple circuit. Seeing the line of horses being followed by cars of people who would jump out to clean up droppings was particularly amusing - the devotion to cleanliness on display!\\n\\nAfter that unexpected morning, I decided to head to Odaiba - Tristan mentioned the Olympic rings were on display in the bay, and visible from Odaiba, so why not check it out.\\n\\nI walked the length of the main Odaiba strip along the shops on the waterfront to a viewing spot for the rings, nabbed some photos, then went to grab lunch - Japanese curry!\\n\\nBefore heading back to the house, I read about an attraction called “teamLab borderless” which was in the area, so decided to check it out. It was a bit pricey, but was a very interesting experience! It’s a “digital art museum,” with very interesting use of walls, open space, mirrors, and perspective to show the various moving pieces. Quite easily spent an hour or so there, and definitely enjoyed the experience!\\n\\nDinner was ramen and gyoza at a place ~5 mins away from the house - this was a nice meal, though noodles still fill me up too easily and I couldn’t finish it all…\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mXadXtS2XJMOjhnnoWG-XlaeLummj0ds?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tgtpKOh010IlnagSUHVJZnFms5VJ88lp?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eqc0o4WxAE0zbSgeYS9oZTq5wYyNmn1B?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1moUiO3kdbwsiGPRxgyoeH2tD0sa_isV4?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13l10BiSr32cTyQGk1-8XQFCNt33emMoR?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B_nC24HJHfY-LPiUdaAka6qzkCiugu0J?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19T6E8B0OT70-nN5FQwwZ5ZefM2E2kLmd?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wt9ReEnhJJZjh7cRIYF7Lib73yTuvQse?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rT0ZCbMIWTHziLajAdQPKcPBt4OY-GU0?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sHCmshf2VbPoa89Uv1oUlBbL16c_NrSr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15ld5s0jzBq2RqZ621LqvmR0DGwh6l--A?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xVko6WnUmjD-IwXGweDpye-o3XM4y51y?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1inonl66ctGtpUP3lud-Xff2poIioLe1i?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F_KojnjgoOGebpzsUDinjswGEowzJ9CL?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17U__5SjVfSGvLFcD19mhS_uzOyCXQQQ2?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jmBxrkW9FRpC7Q3v-HOwQzx-y7WMWN8n?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1G-G4czgQFRNYcmKHn-5bzIjA2V4KcRye?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10zvkFUoC-KIWwJ5TSu5GMw9e6f45MrOt?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mwezKyxR_4ykUlHObJ-DBtfkpqoE9Ph5?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CTvuzB62RS7DC4T8TD2Tu5KaUChTHpeB?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WyOq526dYq_HwYKVNkbpbt280Vc1JEpa?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZaEirgMQZJBC001oV9oY6nKOHmZWzEZg?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kI5E7DobuaAJwVZvVx1dSU-xM2NvYHuZ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JYwqtRytBKPSArL2MmI6mKNWkKGUHeJp?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1v1NhIs1sz6GcvB8lfEWT8tdVqrrltOi7?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ibzp8CSJPNuYM0_8QJBkcrbJ3IILczSe?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-U96E4y1xzZClj2jDcKa1OVZST3ZCoGH?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

This was mainly due to it being easily accessible on the same subway from Tristan’s place, but also because it was early and would actually be open 😉.\\n\\nIt still looks as neat and tidy as I remember it, though because I stuck around for a little while, I got to see a procession of horses from the palace walk around the grounds for a bit. I suspect this was practice or training, as they stuck to a fairly simple circuit. Seeing the line of horses being followed by cars of people who would jump out to clean up droppings was particularly amusing - the devotion to cleanliness on display!\\n\\nAfter that unexpected morning, I decided to head to Odaiba - Tristan mentioned the Olympic rings were on display in the bay, and visible from Odaiba, so why not check it out.\\n\\nI walked the length of the main Odaiba strip along the shops on the waterfront to a viewing spot for the rings, nabbed some photos, then went to grab lunch - Japanese curry!\\n\\nBefore heading back to the house, I read about an attraction called “teamLab borderless” which was in the area, so decided to check it out. It was a bit pricey, but was a very interesting experience! It’s a “digital art museum,” with very interesting use of walls, open space, mirrors, and perspective to show the various moving pieces. Quite easily spent an hour or so there, and definitely enjoyed the experience!\\n\\nDinner was ramen and gyoza at a place ~5 mins away from the house - this was a nice meal, though noodles still fill me up too easily and I couldn’t finish it all…\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mXadXtS2XJMOjhnnoWG-XlaeLummj0ds?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tgtpKOh010IlnagSUHVJZnFms5VJ88lp?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eqc0o4WxAE0zbSgeYS9oZTq5wYyNmn1B?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1moUiO3kdbwsiGPRxgyoeH2tD0sa_isV4?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13l10BiSr32cTyQGk1-8XQFCNt33emMoR?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B_nC24HJHfY-LPiUdaAka6qzkCiugu0J?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19T6E8B0OT70-nN5FQwwZ5ZefM2E2kLmd?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wt9ReEnhJJZjh7cRIYF7Lib73yTuvQse?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rT0ZCbMIWTHziLajAdQPKcPBt4OY-GU0?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sHCmshf2VbPoa89Uv1oUlBbL16c_NrSr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15ld5s0jzBq2RqZ621LqvmR0DGwh6l--A?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xVko6WnUmjD-IwXGweDpye-o3XM4y51y?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1inonl66ctGtpUP3lud-Xff2poIioLe1i?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F_KojnjgoOGebpzsUDinjswGEowzJ9CL?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17U__5SjVfSGvLFcD19mhS_uzOyCXQQQ2?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jmBxrkW9FRpC7Q3v-HOwQzx-y7WMWN8n?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1G-G4czgQFRNYcmKHn-5bzIjA2V4KcRye?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10zvkFUoC-KIWwJ5TSu5GMw9e6f45MrOt?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mwezKyxR_4ykUlHObJ-DBtfkpqoE9Ph5?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CTvuzB62RS7DC4T8TD2Tu5KaUChTHpeB?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WyOq526dYq_HwYKVNkbpbt280Vc1JEpa?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZaEirgMQZJBC001oV9oY6nKOHmZWzEZg?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kI5E7DobuaAJwVZvVx1dSU-xM2NvYHuZ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JYwqtRytBKPSArL2MmI6mKNWkKGUHeJp?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1v1NhIs1sz6GcvB8lfEWT8tdVqrrltOi7?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ibzp8CSJPNuYM0_8QJBkcrbJ3IILczSe?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-U96E4y1xzZClj2jDcKa1OVZST3ZCoGH?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

The area around the station has recently been renovated (ongoing), so I had a look at the “stream” development with all the new shops fronting it - is a very nice strip lined with plum blossoms that might be in bloom soon!\\n\\nNext I headed to Yoyogi park and Meiji shrine, stopping for a coffee along the way. The day was really nice just to relax a little and go at a slower pace through the park. The shrine had a lot of signs along the path showing the history since it was completed - this year marks the 100th anniversary. There is a public holiday on Tuesday, and there seemed to be a lot of indications the place will be filled then.\\n\\nAfter spending a good bit of time in the park, I had to head back to Shibuya to meet Tristan for lunch. We met near the Hachiko statue (a popular meeting place), then found a sushi train for lunch - this was mostly very nice (only one dish didn’t do it for me)! Quite well-priced as well.\\n\\nWe continued on to Shinjuku after lunch, and went up the metropolitan government building to the observation deck for a look over the city. The day was somewhat clear, but not enough to see Mt Fuji.\\n\\nI spotted a flea market in a nearby park while we were high up, so we went there to take a look for something different, then we headed back to the house to chat and play some games for a bit of relaxation 😁.\\n\\nNaoko made dinner tonight (oyakodon plus other vegetables) - this was a delicious meal that looked like it came from a restaurant!\\n\\nFinally for the day was a visit to their local bath house. This was such a great experience! So much larger than I expected, and the variety of baths and things to do was fantastic - cold baths, hot baths (indoor and outdoor), saunas, jet (spa) baths, electro bath, and a water floor thing that you lay on to relax! We spent time in most of these totalling about an hour and a half. Then we enjoyed some green tea in a tatami seating area before we headed home.

It’s only 5 minutes away by bike to the main area, and the place is quite large! Heaps of footpaths to walk or ride down, heaps of gardens and trees (including cherry blossoms which would be insane in bloom), and heaps of open space where families were having fun together, and others were practicing instruments! Oh and there are various sporting fields / grounds where kids were competing and practicing.\\n\\nWe rode around about half the park, then walked around a small section to see some areas a bit closer before we finished up sitting and chatting on seats near our bikes. Had a very friendly and community sort of feel to the whole place which made it a nice pleasant way to spend a little time.\\n\\nAfter we got home, I got myself ready to travel to Nikko for the night. This took a while with all the trains required to get to the town, but was easy enough. Saw some nice countryside and small townships on the local train, but was quite surprised with Nikko itself once I arrived and got off the train - it looks and feels kind of like a snow mountain town! Very pleasant surroundings and the town itself is neat and nicely laid out for tourists.\\n\\nNot many photos as my timing of arrival was just as the sun started to disappear behind the mountains, so better photos tomorrow.\\n\\nAccommodation for the night was in a ryokan called “Annex Turtle Hatori-An” - a very nice smallish place with a great view out the bedroom window! And the owner was a lovely lady who lives in the place (she made sure to point this out when explaining attractions on a map) and did a fantastic job giving a tour around the whole building to show and explain all the things available. Was a positive first impression, and that continued for my stay.\\n\\nDinner was “neapolitan spaghetti” from one of few restaurants in the area near the ryokan, and it was delicious! I wasn’t expecting anything amazing, but felt like a change of food for one meal so was willing to accept it might be average. I don’t know what herbs and spices were in the “sauce” for the dish, but it was so full of flavour, and the price was great too. Definitely a pleasant surprise to wrap up the day!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tgacvU1Q1ohtuzEhmBv9WeCi3MeM15sN?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eL2GtctXq0Xkkar2xJBhKKrG-dEjQsLe?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gxTtlyoQjTQtrHeAbJzVBlpIvaQebAIm?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Sd5lMmhCRexMLbkhcC6n4Qg99vwF4ESU?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zR13buxhjcWhyjNaA9Zr_KqpS2HvHzX2?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LvSafrD61JeVkjzTJ42BCnSOdYK4Tb4m?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/174iHojYdVqqv-9c-2Blna_LsBVWH51gH?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1h9dG9AzQVCCmXZo-x8R7GHMLQlwbr2tp?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cCcbIwTg4pd7ovFCAidOcI5EDlUeK8LT?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CvkN7GBNNOeOl2Dcj92mbc_Q4ZOr7bxA?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iCSEEGsR5odhCX3X_8lVHfcKdUlUZfzJ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OA2BVCvhDCwGv-T_uL86WCKh0ffaFtbh?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CXdg0mMY1JpSLUwcqElsR1-znznNnZ06?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1x7t0YJ2_nmNkjK_YC7GFA72Hb0Ydvgg1?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oD27TGszz_iK8xJ_MVDQisZhHVex-RxN?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uCsfUIUhsQ5iEFV8Viqwnm1BDxmfwbm9?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1K0a56FsMapamlgwemRkjIIPacCWoXcre?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CumlQL_JDkPO6RIe2wL_3cIE9BFlIVpI?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_H32MSj4LqsWMXoi2mgCL19OzSJcoTet?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/112wT_UTsX8Mpg1b-8YeYAQYT_dQQSYm2?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iChkdQbNhL1GqSqqLcZjLjJoI3n2Rlz-?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1D-BBPY4c4VSKMA4zHdZufUjJ9_Yvohyb?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1spLDFdjnt2FLq74Ffl8tLBAUFfg0B4fY?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KSjys5kH7x-5oRiYvXPjuI7nbQz5jGmi?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1U-JPPeLq-kcUAdL4Jd33WzCyM-0o2EUa?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CgVhfRf4BZk52FX5GGWXhx701FOwm2SM?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gNDQ6yHhy7dQG6XIHUPBekr4BTN19Jpq?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

This whole area is perched on a hill at the end of the main street through town, which gives it a nice secluded feel.\\n\\nThe main shrine to visit here was Toshogu, which is the resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu. I went here because it was highly reviewed, but I still wasn’t really expecting to be as impressed by it as I was. The size of the complex is huge compared to other shrines I’ve been to, so it had more of everything, and the structures all had insane detail and effort put into them. And all of this was before I reached the “inner shrine” where Ieyasu rests. Getting to this involved climbing a decent number of stone stairs to reach the highest point of the shrine complex. This area was beautiful, even if it wasn’t the most extravagent part of the shrine - the natural environment around the area really added to the whole feel of the place!\\n\\nAfter really being blown away by Toshogu, the rest of the shrines and temples in the area were more typical - not unimpressive, just not to the same level as Toshogu haha.\\n\\nA walk back to the train station marked the end of my time in Nikko, but there was still time left in the day by the time I got back to Tokyo.\\n\\n(One more post follows for today!)\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QhJ60EZodnORzb_AO-TGIOmQsQHtDGZj?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SwJSSP0KAD53h66NdZmd33qwYh8-SWpm?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10q3LvcPzvplRKc-cTiMcl470Bb_Xfkk6?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ba1hTZ4LeA9Rz9BMU219V5j5QnY-c9je?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m8F5DJhhm8chCLsxKIHm4A2LUxWojkAI?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TA8UQHx4uPJl7b_R-FDs62OZdQE0_KhG?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TGMChYvVaTO7dCOCq6NhsODnWXn26f-T?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eb2dDN_JSx38e4UiCaMezRjBfKn8IoIQ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wXrvoC66T93CLwlA7q-vs_BQuxKABj7v?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1N17fP2Mf5ZtWvuv3dhX22pKNyj4wep5g?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HP2tnLSTWJOLFBpClSmfKaW7QzSBq19v?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vuUxjUuwawka2JWkkf6QQKNHCFytfdE_?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jj25ZmoUOW5GCDc9NYu1V-7xqt6mdd5w?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F7hbNAML6DmJ81MO1EevgvNDjDKv2034?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zm8sb_gOoOvHrwFLpL-v97-fsh96ivhy?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rApgwfmWJjLqvgXS2Ga5iGwQc6fazzYr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t04YfPJZHKAWCOcVsf2Bo7KjmkYg3gBG?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oXvOM-NbFsLGWl2yVHNAn2H3PUw5fdsm?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OCr4QRs3hHRqnbRf6pfQQEf5MeNSLq6Q?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uig1fSvnJEMmxel3e8I9Z0XH6YupENFj?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tJYVuM3z4henwRPqxkKUJwdFt2udHdJq?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TRB96DwAJTk0tHJv14-Cir9ek9gN_Hui?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xQ1BIBWQkd5d3uDEOi3S4jEw-43Jzn8x?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dV_PO-JMqu6KfWYGR30e9uXb5bq26gpJ?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17crCcQDQgROdZUEAQeM8lGru9H0lBGiO?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mxcy-Qv5mANdA8TaLoMHBvl-rJxwHa2m?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CLP-xShGSZIrVFoGPLS2qvTn4l8GcHv7?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

After the rides started closing, we parted ways and I caught a train to Kawaguchiko to stay the night.\\n\\nDinner was delicious teppanyaki from a very small local place (3 tables).\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MwtorAlMpiJ4RFbmBJHmys8G_zeLZ3vc?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Efj6BG5PVdDBG_j_fGCsburd1tnHUGOU?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kRcXcfTJDQ9p4z3RixEZXYQhj4k89gAX?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15I1DmPs5XmLSUUD-ym5Kjh9lf9akRIQ6?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZbUUxoOJAxT2ZM0eQkCz2FszBlWkdfhd?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a3hG4Jqc-xKq7N9lg9ZKeT53rgI7vaiP?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RWjJZIb2tPto1t53QUR6BCvSqw60t3m-?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hYm68Wf-Vg4lhtJKp02BR3RMK7X24oDJ?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t_NTFhDMpLe6HqyljtNK08mmqvc8UrPP?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QOXELBAfkmAGxK8IWzuAciynUAjUwc3-?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Kfs4Pf4UvBaGDNm5QThz8dIMPpLeAO11?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18B01Kmj4-9Xvxv5KnSjYB5PqWW_8ksrS?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eU8jL2HQX99FmEF0Y0WHziyFqOUj6UF_?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pH6_j-J7Vg_MMNjozAwJqWKGB2ydZA4b?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UQahXw-XnWDXjO4jnYRMp7d-AONUatOc?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EbFokN5AWvbs28_gHDWrTw_iil0nnfLq?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MWZHnzFcSl001bXw4RtyEo8FqdrpPrqY?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TwP_5Tlur_N2EBpnXr_OmjIpdIpwkrSg?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vNMoAAWJ0j94Cb1QA2lDe934NVsWKI1H?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mqz4KaawWUO5gJbUiio4pvmoszXo8d66?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KwZzsUIkzqtL-5D_RxkF-bvVmrQbY5BA?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

It turns out I was the only guest staying with them tonight! They were very informative and explained the layout of the building and where the main areas were, then once they knew I was planning to hike up Mt Haguro, gave some advice and information on the condition of the trail! They even let me borrow an umbrella just in case I needed it for the hike!\\n\\nThe hike itself was impressive, both in scenery and challenge! There are over 2400 steps (according to the information pamphlet I was given about the mountain) - I can’t confirm this, as the area was fairly significantly under snow, and counting steps would have been way too much effort on top of just getting up them! As it turned out, I only just made it to the top - the steepness and difficulty of staying stable moving up snow covered stone steps almost made me turn back, but I managed to push onwards and made it.\\n\\nThe whole area is covered in huge cedar trees, and even with the snow cover it all looked really stunning! During the warmer months when there would be more greenery and easier hiking, it would be very impressive I’m sure.\\n\\nAt the top there were some decent views of the surrounds, though a bit blocked by trees. And there is a large shrine as well, that I imagine sees many visitors in the warmer months.\\n\\nThankfully the return trip was much easier despite the snow - getting foot holds was a lot easier when being able to lean a little back, and lead with my heels into the snowy steps.\\n\\nOnce I arrived back at the accommodation, the male host met me and was keen to hear if I made it, and how the snow was. He mentioned this has been a much warmer winter than normal, with less than half the snow they would normally see.\\n\\nDinner was at 6:30 and provided by the hosts. As I was the only one staying for the night, I could pick my time and had the dining area to myself. The meal was amazing! So much food, all very tasty, and immaculately presented! I tried to eat as much as I could, so as to not let any go to waste. I couldn’t quite get there, but put in a pretty good effort. When finished, I headed for my room, and thankfully caught their attention with my footsteps, resulting in a bit of a chat again. This gave me the chance to express my gratitude for the meal in English amd Japanese (one of the few words I know - “oishi” meaning “delicious!”). They both seemed quite happy, and after chatting a little again about my hike, I was able to prepare for a quiet night in my room, after a shower and bath (Japanese style).\\n\\nA long start to the day, but I’m very happy I managed to complete the hike, and don’t think I could have picked a better place to stay for the night!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DUp49uM-thUT_xtjXi2799GLqvutMuGc?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PTseLkmu9y6zo3Kf1HAIxiR0wjyMRhBg?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AZBFXZXQTy8U1SKI4JIJ5gBaXUOaxpJS?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qVQlHsfpaGv9Oqa_H65D5qG_KVkkZDGG?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QcnFGqbFX11UkDlllLAc-UA6LzM7OHIA?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dHClIPNItG8JvKhhSbVK91S5FKvQisXL?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n0io5LFgFUCZZdSyuEauB7-5PQElNsP7?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iYQtDRGJe5ExwpADy2yd73CoOeZVYPNT?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13weMhA_lqxiLWP6hKOj5J4sk0JAtqbuy?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1c4Ev_iBMmdyZiqaUhMEBanPQinJonI9u?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1POcjEgygJ8-I5zzDJQzCXASivnRPa1mV?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PQTIhFRK0oj3qN2w-MZK0PdQLJjNXzTx?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ppt42Pip_iMRVMAxFQ0JIK_d1rAhY4X4?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aCGTzW8PFAkn9Qr94U9zlSY1yo9u8VeC?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1U9DmJ7Hz1WQbSqXzsSgc0nTNM1mYrJFZ?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1P8z-XfGOSiRI_TpauGb1hQOO5tip1pGg?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1c_5M7B9VPPpJrZMyzJy60JSE-UcMzPeB?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1z49tZtCpabgo86r3Ylu7tQgdnHIEp8Ci?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rN2VZMAmKvJTI7UKDmsQ1bv18XVMnmBn?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11rN0DUXbLHnPRe6q1TXYeR6G0CR4SByW?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1g_lZJhs60gH7NMc61joMGurzQoEBYDQJ?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/188aRnOBNrBA8Akv87KeEXN1r09-Tfhbr?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f_3y_4D9LSnSy883FspK0E2_Ygdn89O3?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1C4oQCx5yFwjxg2rj1YrdrMsHMnCSib2p?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18lwr2uW_-1UGOTqQ7Tq7JElZO2gUJW5g?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fNR6WgDIn93aLBZlRTzkxWv6Iv7zhCSV?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NquI-BG91zZ0tCBwKuepHL0Bg41fcXgv?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

This was actually the fastest way by many hours (trains would run so infrequently that there would be long transfer waits), so time for something abit different!\\n\\nAs it turned out, riding the bus was quite enjoyable. The roads were all smooth and comfortable, even through all the mountains, and the views were quite remarkable! A decent amount of snow, plenty of bare trees, and a few frozen rivers / lakes. It really was a nice surprise of a journey to my next stop.\\n\\nActually riding the bus was easy enough, though I did forget to collect a ticket on entering the bus (should have not been first…), which resulted in a friendly person alerting me and helping sort it out haha!\\n\\nOnce I arrived in Yamagata city, I left my luggage at the hotel (check in was somewhat later) and grabbed some lunch.\\n\\nI had decided today would be the day to get to Ginzan onsen - I had the time, and knew it would be a little trickier of a trip than others, so wanted to get on with it haha. This involved a train ride and a bus ride, though the bus was a little more challenging to sort out as the stops and signs outside had no English this time. Using some online help (and paying attention to the crowds), I figured out the right bus and made it there.\\n\\nGinzan onsen is a hot spring town built around an old silver mine (the name is literally translated to “silver mountain hot spring”), but is now a tourist spot for sightseeing during the day, and hot spring / inn stays during the night.\\n\\nThe small town is unique and impressive enough during day time, but it really comes to life at night (I stayed until the last bus back to the station at 6:20pm) - as the sunsets, all the ryokan and restaurants light up, and guests staying in the town start to emerge to enjoy the atmosphere. It reminded me so much of “Spirited Away” that I assume this sort of place had to be some kind of inspiration for the movie.\\n\\nGetting back to the station was interesting as well! There were 2 busses on the way, so I assumed that would be the case on the way back, but I was conscious that they could be busy, so I got to the bus stop to line up a little early. This was a good choice! The queue was already long, and in the end, I was on the second bus, and some people were left to find their own way back (probably by taxi)! This all meant the bus was a bit late, which meant I missed the train I was hoping to catch, putting me onto a later local train back to Yamagata! This was all fine, just unplanned and slightly longer than I had hoped.\\n\\nStill, I’m glad I got out to Ginzan, and today as well - tomorrow will be much less activity for a nice change!\",\"images\":[{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RedUFsA30AEGI1Ep9yELnmcPXUe7i7cC?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n1vj9L7pQjZ0YjQlz1y1h9jp8xjRkyBG?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FptkdhnW_pscgydVWyc6pjet6Gm_FA7v?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lIasK0UZt7phTWW1J9i8rKdEI5w-xVF1?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JEjrpYiaCcAfCpD-fo-Ljmcu-J5h-cp5?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/102YrO_RIXTtFwPypLDZjOiBLV6qEL_BY?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F-aFOQ_U6EwE7YFKPBRIUJcvgL-PLfsO?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1z-Tq5D_TN0q1gCu7RyCni3WDYK4uSims?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1arXZt4lf75KPbK1p2wgdbsQMYedDZTCn?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KnOtPgehBFP9aohr7F0UWVBoUaTZnfrN?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Dg4t793JPpDUQz7fHsYyZ4TiS2zUKF39?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YPmZkMiO5Ugm842dRiF0dn56kVK0ALvt?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1l0IpinLQ9T9aJpEB4-T7q7aaGqt-TL1l?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BTvAr-413T6Yt9jOXx3BHWka2aT1mPKj?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13kYDlHXScQvRDIjzsa7Pjpq73UkQ1IJD?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DRVjIOHoCDu4nKsi3swTiSG6khFL98vJ?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EARduWYXn3YDQICrqL1GBKC8cLIgk_G-?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XYqBOefKz3jcrjWa9XiNjyq_xhNYjVia?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wC6-agW1GPNvBzIKzmlzpO1tZRa7j_51?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14O3b65aibBDcUJ4M48VzWqOLFGxTgGrx?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19AVFKvRTw5F-kQMEr-3fZzuLEWjQAXCT?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11oaB4P0ePYAmmLEOWTZnpxdEv_uGFL0H?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1idxXveMhm8kZRMwO6x64wkZPccTWQSXV?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r01XsSspkRSVf7UgizDNRgUF_yrXgK_V?authuser=0\"},{\"src\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cAdoOB28zWbR9Io2aVdAKU-eYC5l_yPp?authuser=0\",\"collageSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i0MXKZyC08yrv4oEutWXx1omhUtivSF6?authuser=0\",\"navSrc\":\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CBokphd8qbriIaMfzHc1-Z3d1YxqBYo8?authuser=0\"}]}"}</script>

Though these weren’t covered in snow thankfully). The entire hike to the main grounds had stone statues and carved rocks lining the path. The sheer number of “things” scattered about made the hike really unique and interesting, and that was on top of the beautiful natural setting all around - large cedar trees and moss covered rocks everywhere.\\n\\nThe gate to the main temple complex marks about 2/3 of the steps throughout the whole area, which branches out a little after the gate. It’s not huge, but definitely larger than I expected for the location!\\n\\nThe buildings were mostly fairly typical, but the location and the views made the whole experience much more interesting.

They were neatly presented with ponds and water flowing, continued up the mountainside to give excellent views over the town and ocean, and had plum blossoms of various colours in a pretty good state of bloom! I hadn’t expected to see any blossoms on the trip (I didn’t realise plum blossoms were a thing and when they bloom), so this was amazing to see! Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed Hasedera!\\n\\nThe great Buddha at Kotoku-in was the next destination not too far away. After the impressive display at Hasedera, the grounds at Kotoku-in were a little underwhelming, but the giant Buddha was incredible to see. It’s hard to comprehend how such a large structure was made so long ago and continues to stand. Going inside gave a good look at the processes used to make it, which just adds to the impressiveness!\\n\\nTo finish the day I followed a major hiking path from nearby the giant Buddha back towards the station. This was a decent hike that took me past a few small monuments along the way, but the real highlight was at the end of the hike, just before I reached the roads back to the station. I visited Zeniarai Benten and really enjoyed the atmosphere of relaxation. The entrance was a cave carved out of part of the rock surrounding the shrine complex. Once inside, everything was neat and a bit more compact than normal, which added a “cosy” sort of feel to the place. Plenty of people were visiting as well, many happily sitting on seats in the middle of the complex, chatting or eating some snacks. The place looked great, was in a very unique location, and had an excellent atmosphere! A great way to round out the day in Kamakura.\\n\\nFrom there it was an easy walk through a park area to the station, and back to the house.\\n\\nAfter a slightly early dinner tonight, Tristan and I went to the bath house again, and this was almost as enjoyable as the first time - “almost” because at the end the machine for water and green tea wasn’t working ☹️.

The main 2 trains to Takayama totalled about 4.5 hours, plus there was a little time transferring and getting to the Shinkansen in Tokyo.\\n\\nThankfully once I arrived I was able to check in to my hotel early and drop my luggage before heading to the historic district and Shiroyama park, which is where the Takayama castle ruins are. Also, it was snowing a little in town for the whole afternoon!\\n\\nWalking to the historic district I spotted a lot of restaurants advertising beef - I think the Hida region is maybe known for their quality beef? The historic district itself was very neat and interesting - a narrow street lined with old style buildings and drains down below, meaning each shop had a little bridge leading inside. Lots of food and souvenier shops, but they all looked really nice with the traditional facades and styling.\\n\\nNext was Shiroyama park, which is a sort of walking trail park with a few monuments scattered around, and a couple of areas where foundation / ruins of the old castle can be found. I enjoyed walking through here with the snow everywhere and very few other people around. At one point I reached a monument (which kind of act like guideposts around the trails), stopped to take a photo, and realised it was completely silent. I’ve only had that experience once before that I can remember (on the side of a mountain when snowboarding in NZ), so I enjoyed that for a moment before continuing. The top of the park / hill gave some decent views of the area through the trees as well.\\n\\nBack to the hotel, I decided to try and have a hot bath in a private onsen that is on the top floor of the hotel. Luckily I was able to after a 5 or so minute wait, and it was worth it! Not as extravagent as the bath house, but with an excellent view looking over the city and mountains, and the privacy to relax and just soak it in.\\n\\nDinner was chicken curry, naan, salad, and a drink from a small Indian Nepalese restaurant not too far from the train station. This was fantastically delicious and a great variation from Japaneae food all the time 😉.

A very thick piece of toast with butter and strawberry jam, and coffee. This was nice to have - I haven’t eaten toast since I arrived haha.\\n\\nAfter checking out of the hotel, I walked to the Hida folk village - an “open air museum” showcasing traditional buildings, tools, and general way of life for people in the region from many centuries ago.\\n\\nThis place was very interesting! Really unique things on display inside many of the buildings, and the buildings themselves with various roofing materials and styles. Was a relaxed way to learn a bit more about how things worked in the region a long time ago, before modern conveniences.\\n\\nOnce I finished at the folk village, I had enough time to revisit the historic district to see how it looked without snow. I enjoyed the walk through the street again, but I think the snow made for a more novel experience.\\n\\nThe whole afternoon was travelling to Kyoto, and this took longer than anticipated due to train delays in the first leg which made me have to catch a later Shinkansen for the second leg. Still, not a big problem, just meant a little more time travelling than expected!\\n\\nDinner was from a small restaurant not too far from the hotel. I had a pork cutlet with miso sauce set (with rice, miso soup, tofu, and shredded cabbage). This was really tasty, well-priced, and fresh! Ordering was done with a vending machine (thankfully with pictures for all the menu options), then the staff would take a piece of the receipt for the kitchen, and use the other part to identify you when your food is ready! It’s a neat system that works well and gave me no trouble.
