    "content": "Another day, another coffee shop! Today's was a nice little place tucked behind the main street of town. We pretty much took over the whole place with out group, but the one lady working there did a great job and made some excellent coffee!\nThe rest of the morning was doing a little shopping, then Fergburger since everyone was keen to give it a try - it lived up to the reputation and everyone was raving about what they had. Is understandable why it's so popular!\nWith lunch done, we made our way to the wharf to board a boat for a lake cruise and farm tour for the afternoon.\nThe cruise itself was great - nice and comfortable, with excellent views of the mountains all around. We passed the old TSS Earnslaw (which is normally what you ride for the trip, but was undergoing maintenance) and got some commentary of some landmarks along the way, but the main event was the farm...\nWe disembarked and quickly started a tour of the public area of the farm. This took us around to see various animals (pigs, sheep, goats, cows, alpacca, highland cows, and a donkey), some of which we could feed, all while hearing about the farm and its operations. It was a nice pleasant bit of time, interacting with some animals, all while being surrounded with incredible views.\nOnce the tour ended, we had a high tea in the main dining building. This was excellent, and the views from our table were breathtaking - looking out over the lake and the mountains while having delicious food.\nFinally we had the opportunity to see and hear about sheep herding and shearing, including a fantastic display by one of the farm dogs. This was a great presentation and rounded out an excellent day.\nAfter a bit of gift shopping we cruised back to town and headed back to the house for an easy dinner and quite evening.",
