Timed things pretty well again and had just enough time to have a bite to eat for lunch before we had to get to the gate. Flight was very smooth, just a little delayed at each airport sitting on the tarmac.\n\nSan Francisco is immediately a more interesting city than we have been to so far. Rested in the hotel room and figured out what to have for dinner - Italian at Fisherman’s Wharf - some of the best well priced Italian I have had :)","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r-gpBDk5lNSd7A4I7zi6Ad-SkhBnpuCS?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rbkd-vCG1GTNTGb6DZcUZgU5AqJNtjNz?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L1YOvQK2Xqxe-jl3j-icInuFjIs7CIko?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RDm6Ic-1g3XC-bxrLUi50ZFbmWkOVeDH?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OBiI8MzgCDqGZe-9-yy15m-CYxSDZqPp?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1u6EIk1pIFFuOpH-ELsbtnOO84lFqgZm2?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19tI_8ZO8IQBdqlkwqb-MrV3PeJJB9YlG?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19nTTqFHydlUWJfG4E1TfspFdXy1uLiOv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EvT_Y-OMepMvrPUgLgY8jBPcFsIXcrDS?authuser=0"}]}
