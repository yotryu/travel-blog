Also a huge building with a rock wall on the outside that looked like it was able to move further up the side of the building! The main reason for heading in was to have a few drinks at Space Station (a video game bar). We managed to find our way to it and we impressed! Stacks of new and old games covering every spare piece of the small bar. The drinks were pretty good too! Named after games or characters (e.g. the Dr. Mario - has Dr. Pepper in it among other things), and playing remixed game music and chiptunes (e.g. Anamanaguchi), this place was really chilled and just a good bit of fun :)\n\nSo much fun that we kinda lost track of time and had to rush back to the trains to get 2 back to the main Osaka station before getting one of the last trains (if not the last) back to Kyoto - we even had to go a local train because the Shinkansen had already stopped for the night! Still, we made the most of the day that’s for sure.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VpYcGeX9nERZrTAqkl4f0fa0z5K_0NyF?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SYw_lumf1rSN4aC6GCFSRFy9Y1Xt9jYy?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kMT5HP-IOeDZLaM6z0D70ZzNczlICEuj?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1szeRZrPZRh2M5VM6SqRNaVLOyVfCyWY0?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GjC5lZ47A0bMBSE6vIBXnqZmvxUez6FQ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dD7BoCJmica9qd9cPQZKXv1ACqNNrI-l?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1umv71wzdtEXu24OQ_ecT8KzJTW8ehNcC?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17sxqf0fCT1vn1gqqQhuD8saRLfcDdxh9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iJmIkcL2kJrbh_KiZZRFk_U543K2Qlpt?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-jFnEC-ad6Qo5bREQ3Km0NCzsPYiIxDL?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15td8ywn5Za2MfpkBYSOOaoBjKO1N2vzk?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16eVV8g6t4QINZWga9OskfMB_vES3OcEz?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1J2uqSK5uPSrqn7h-xa0ja_c_2UD95MwO?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OvB8V4mu9FQcecJHce79N6aLLeAIBQML?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GnHy4DTseEQYzXxNS49gi7Yz5gpXNqEJ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FV171vGqBG9jks1UXiZUF487HHfI3DQo?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xqlb1k9tl0ipa97Mxn8QdkzHi6dwyNqa?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MFc1KnGrLx5_8v93_DtXSmL1G4G4mDTT?authuser=0"}]}
