There is a “course” setup in the Queenstown Gardens - basically there is a tee off point for each “hole” and you throw the frisbee from the tee to the hole (it’s basically a chain basket to catch the disc). Each hole is at least a couple of throws distance from the tee, and you have to dodge around trees and other obstacles - a fun way to use the time up!\n\nAfter we finished, we were pretty much ready to return the car and get to the airport. And with that, the holiday was pretty much over! A good trip for sure!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uiNVHxdSiAZfIMoRZhJmmdvUWo6uyPRA?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fQzR2sIn25wcpJrGDdk8x20F5dScMJh8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kaCosr-R1hsNB30kwPovlLCg5FvZX7W0?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/124hj3_FAmfkx1tP-Oo5FOa0SMketlNLd?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19pVJ-up5ysqJOi2oacIVN0CIeJnVGuma?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IuUyYbQv3VXA0AV01gOWe_YiCF-_II6B?authuser=0"}]}
