Our guide met us at the airport (along with several others on the tour) before driving us to our accommodation - being in a shuttle van driving at 130+km/h sure was a way to start the trip off!\n\nThe next day was a guided tour of some noteworthy sites. The Imperial Palace was intended to be first, but was closed for the day, so we were taken to Kiyosumi Gardens which turned out to be really picturesque! Tortoise in the pond, autumn leaves starting to show, and a nice walk around - was a great start.\n\nNext we headed on to Sens≈ç-ji where we had a nice rice bowl lunch before exploring the temple and its grounds. Many-a-fortune was obtained here, most being left there as is the custom for undesirable fortunes.\n\nFinally we barely made it to Meiji jingu for a very quick peek at sunset before it closed. Was a shame this was rushed, but we did get to see it at least.
