A late breakfast and a walk to the Shinagawa station showed us some interesting sights before we sorted out our rail passes and reserved seats for the bullet trains.\nNext was lunch at reasonable sized restaurant on the side of the road - tempura scallops and prawns with rice (we all tried the same thing haha!). Was a good meal and got us keen on Japanese lunches.\nWalking to Tokyo Tower, we saw some more temples with prayer cards hanging ready for the year of the horse. The tower itself gave a good view of the city - the day was clear, and we went to the very top observation deck. We saw Mt. Fuji in the distance (just), and the other guys were amazed at the size of greater Tokyo.\nFinally we spent the rest of the afternoon and evening in Akihabara Electric City. Electronics, figurines, “cutie girls”, insane 6-floor arcades - we had a heap of fun here! Pretty much is the definition of visual and aural overstimulation! We finished up by having yakiniku for dinner before we headed back to the hotel.\nA huge first day, but saw heaps and look forward to seeing more tomorrow now that we have the rail passes from the get go :)","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1o8_7IK2Y7do2oU7rmN51X5u45sn12uqq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WhuQTzhMPJ_IjJ9sbWeaqxvZg4XnN5at?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1u9-ZBlrBODSYT56pvrcKI0Cf33FKCZvz?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1I7Xmvi7suGL3Bz-JQNCKA5DR7lCSstmV?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f9KvtFEAZeB7gGZmNsiaPELRwDP1jJ25?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MONV63Jo13xV5qavvqQLYo5pbaPyKwTZ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cT1E_kqaDsiaBxwJMEgyazfmjir9dVPM?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CN4Ys_2Yp8_09GKjrg22RzluZEbF-0e-?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aAdP9zK9PFJ7qHxbqhV4KX8hHa673JUc?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XHqTYm5Psb56UtVaICtpXfH4GdxB22qV?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1h_Bq_yawSA5kD1M5TBtu10th37esxpoZ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fZtV2PiNSlsaMLlHtiQjzyFcpbxZ0dSp?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OX7BbczB_PHohCSadQdyV4EO8GlfF86z?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OC-T83LKQnmWkyYLIuMP1war2oLEMAK9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CuIsKxNptezvTXnr5dosFk6uPU055lfm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qI87QXOGM4wK2cgPsUOdte6_jw0jjxSL?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-8RH5GZn-VSWJ5Te9I6tf8O64R-KOxLo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Sct0P3ZQCb1ZvWHePY444QRVK5SDtBvU?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dIXMA9DBwdlGAndc5GqAf5EwKUNRFZhr?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SzMS9pHsmuD406IMOTAkq75NEae-udPF?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kIARKIFC_FeB6gWJ4w7SAQUfCSfY_ctr?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18FJ0Iu2TWLACvWEp5Skpmd-oBU-MetWy?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JkxFqWH91009mn4lwUHT0oPFBhiesX9f?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1O0pJvQGBMPLwJw1xIPYvyknxLq8AA4k2?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hmOW9M_Hua-6mkz0CIiMh9ccxjtc3HVf?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i5BqrivfeWEkPzzMBOyxXBjOMO2RKvow?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-01mxZqkh2c-VqgHc94uH6A99a_ZqHro?authuser=0"}]}
