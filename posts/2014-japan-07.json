{"id":"2014-japan-07","collection":"2014-japan","date":"2014 January 31","title":"Tokyo - Shinjuku, Yoyogi, Shibuya","content":"After the Ghibli Museum we walked from Shinjuku to Shibuya, through Yoyogi park. Yoyogi park is huge, and very quiet compared to outside with the trains and traffic - it was a pleasant change to the usual Tokyo experience. On the way we walked through Meiji shrine in the centre of the park - this one was a bit different, with large open space in the inner grounds.\n\nContinuing to Shibuya we crossed a stupid number of people lining up for popcorn (the line was at least 50m long outside the shop!). Then we saw tons of people out the front of Yoyogi Stadium - turns out a J-Pop boy band “J Soul Brothers” was performing there tonight! We had to take the opportunity to get some photos around the swarm, and Trent picked up a scarf (which terrified the lady getting the merchandise - we were probably the only foreigners in the entire area!). It was definitely a unique experience seeing all these people so excited about a band we have no idea about.\n\nWhen we finally made it to Shibuya, we managed to meet up with Tristan and spent the night in Shibuya, checking out some interesting shops and getting some assistance thanks to him! It was a lot of fun to catch up and have a different dinner, so we look forward to another day with Tristan and Naoko soon!\n\nAlso: Trent and Jules are addicted to Crane games (i.e. skill testers but more evil). The last photo is a collection of their winnings (so far). I’m just laughing and enjoying watching haha.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XdTBUCHDKciFvkeJNytoEGMWGcH4f3gU?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fpHFys1SZsb-RNCApIr3fH2QdGljr2kJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1C0CDmmctrPcLU4XA5nCiKim6t5tfT3kw?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nT1Zf7PADrOrlY77c2DetYrpyt-zp5f9?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/100ZHtuhAJxb9zmWr_ZIERzFpEwCkd-kt?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1e9GKU6qVclJnlV2fYUXyNlJN7EaBD6KR?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Vp1hKZ301YQsOYRH3eN07AoCQYphOQfG?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1unw6J48la1i2EIvY43D1s2EJVz2DR7Yk?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10u6f4Z9rWwPCxLbENT6AziCC4_O0qPTH?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14gfYCbEYbMHisOuoY12R_yxPQ4vrOaBd?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pD5gYY87h1bunLzL8q-URUpSF1mMcpKI?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Sf14vm6HHXPyU-fmboh3I2v3BBFsiTSx?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10gAJUeKaS-2ei7fahAbJEr2OTLgrM3tx?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LOQrec2iAGlYrGmUHtMVYa4U0XeRcDhs?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ETHJg57FycmTj5WZg9Z0ULvIFzraFkV6?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MIpgpe-q8olDB4_QMfAZceHxee63V7La?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kwWDDxOfazlOm-ghBqOPYShLT9lM2wlb?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19vuwhxaMAFuS77b27knatzShKwqU4qBt?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_7JC8kTmo9vOIGrZ4KzLTwvbHrHAlxUC?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xcxOSQtVahEwhFgddlCqdz1zligCKlD9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-xFAR8Rpq6YKxRdPxu0lQ1YeHiSRAQL_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1P4db5g_G9FfjC2GqKlLnHHiavUvUInmV?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gv2-oWL96SdeuJj975_5hIdQP9yUt2wX?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wzJWvG5Dbn6u2eLAEthXRSNukgrptwaP?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13VneMEqM-Jd_vo7THGgYu7ry5o2_HtGq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sdfCrsNWpzt97yjuPXQYA--bMei4CzIk?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DILi8QzEnSrf7Bw-7ezGpV8DhpIm2IbK?authuser=0"}]}
