The setup was quite neat, with traditional items on display, and information about all the steps involved. And it wouldn't be a trip to a brewery without sampling some of its wares. There was also a good opportunity for some unique souvenir shopping, which many people took advantage of.\n\nNext up was being dropped at Shin-Kobe station to ride the Shinkansen (bullet train) to Himeji. While not a long ride, it was enough to give a great sense of how impressive, smooth, and comfortable the trains are. Everyone departed very pleased to have had that as part of the trip!\n\nOnce in Himeji we were taken to the castle entrance and left to explore. Thankfully this visit there were no construction or refurbishment works happening, so we were able to see and experiencing the full scale of the castle. It is still an incredible place to visit, though climbing to the top was crowded and took a while. Still, well worth it with the views and seeing the internal structure.\n\nWe had a small amount of time to see some of the castle grounds, then grabbed a late lunch before it was time to continue on to the hotel, which was positioned right next to Fukuyama station and castle, which made for a really cool place to stay!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oMouwX9Vw0Aakzj-Cwr3HVMxIOgX9Gw8?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yUF5P__7gzR1r5NFzDgDPH0YsfUDiEdQ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JaPjCX-046UI0BbLyb5q6mgmCGS_zq7k?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1l8062JvdOyBUIaVIakZlL3MYxzPlpuSG?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yEJ9S0WjFwSKjfEpphCoAMBbZOYSfnoc?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1g17OlnjwDIeROW7CBbLzisoq0K2jkTM1?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yFAK6VwcRqDgqBk4_OZOtrAWXDZmTqxT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yvXT1nSlmmFoLhdXxE7niM2MQb9dXfxc?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Q3bP0ZjqOLeSZn9JiOH10kh-67_oRYOu?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rcto9YnOWz-TIkFzVczLKQBN0RW58le2?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xugrrxlLwJ3sfmADuNZHcIKC808XppUJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ch_jtOAJ3Sd_5AC0osstjSc98HHAfrDz?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ivinsGYPb7sGVwYmuyULAqfWI5iKxbLY?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MNhRrB2CBW4rQIeYGZrvcbS4zkZEZxFm?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13kur7VaJ230al4BUMpVFM29CE8MaQn5i?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WAw7omozpMMDRaFnyQ-YhCUtJ5arPpoN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16j_3BVP7sGXoJ-pXRB_Ah0D3owYAm2UO?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xfUKTBvx-rWM6X_UiDuUlYQbfe-Jt8d-?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fPGfNCwlKDRfIIvkvjjDOP43Pn19V5V2?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zhCSOfbQ72SrzuHxsRVKhHBamNrzKmIx?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dbYEJWzb9nJbqrs2HU0fOO4_2mv8w-1E?authuser=0"}]}
