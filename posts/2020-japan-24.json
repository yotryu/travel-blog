{"id":"2020-japan-24","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 24","title":"Imabari → Miyajima","content":"After the long day yesterday, I decided to take the easier route to Miyajima - instead of visiting Matsuyama and catching a ferry / boat to Hiroshima, I opted to train back to Okayama then Shinkansen to Hiroshima. Travel time was similar, but involved a lot less effort, and I was happy to have a quieter and cheaper day at the expense of seeing some new areas.\n\nThe first train ride took me along the north coast of Shikoku, then over the sea again (at a different, very long bridge). This made for some neat sights to see, so it wasn’t all about being lazy in the end!\n\nOnce in Hiroshima, I made my way straight to Miyajima island so I could check in and walk around the island before everything shut. Unfortunately the “floating” shrine gate (“torii”) and the ropeway to the top of Mt Misen were both undergoing maintenance, so that reduced the sights to see and things to do a bit. Walking about and experiencing the island was still great though - the number of snack food stores is incredible for the size of the place (lots of locals and foreign tourists visit each day), and seeing the variety of things on offer was fun!\n\nAfter the day visitors had left and the majority of shops shut, I went to find a restaurant for dinner. I thought I might be able to try okonomiyaki tonight, but the main place in town selling it had an hour wait (which I knew thanks to a kind patron who translated the owner’s information as I walked in). So I went to another nice restaurant I had passed earlier and got a nice Japanese roast beef meal instead - this was quite tasty, and a novel take on the roast beef I am used to!\n\nThe aim is to try some okonomoyaki tomorrow since I missed out today!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DJ_OmI51lwPfo3-wJOnyeGVcxX070Oa-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1De_G8clbd2PykxviisGDYRQ6Wn1Z8uR8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1v2kdxioXynFNgfWsND0HSbnVzcVExSaS?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BoGplFqT1AS21P5bZDIDd0OEPrTxtD6v?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16ws_sdzveif_IX6VAp9IuYg73upiLgd4?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1K_BKyBLt_9OFrJAZj-z7z1TRmfgD-Svl?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HPT7gmAf1yzcO12IZSVWkhJhPsrl4ivh?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-2UmvBTVKIL_TWjpSg1GiDAY4QDLtlIx?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OqwMKRrvMD7FPXCx1BriV6PTj2KhwUr9?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tj1Joy3tSm-ERf1af_QiGJVYypsWNzoR?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zAtY1JGEZGawKVKzscMsbkZOWU02p8iW?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QUzGx8rYL5OVtu_P0c7WXpQenRcwHG-x?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13txHbwcMHfgd0Jf6fu99mkMopKIaLxfW?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aBo4WGclLZZyyMlASlt1VKjYVj0Gqv0Z?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FunDv989-2HCBJ3jWGuuGBIiA_I_cYuT?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1p3tH_B_Y79Loecvyh-WqXv2OKiG5mQMV?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GYEyJpMd2kxfEp5t3tfqrcCmCJafHQbi?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iUdffnEaCRMfE1quogM2NTIaDzQQxHa-?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bQinKGPohU06OlotBwVDP1vfUDgJ_BLV?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gy2aAr868eC3os5D-TTsLxAhDMtB5Sp4?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hvknB_F9y2Y6s-0yqk85QYf1EHj1VqMF?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1J3Nnv5g6zOJEsmFVfwy4IZEjPgKFF6V9?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Vb0A93dt5LYrfhuuKA-WiHAZDnQPc0yo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qhWKMNH79obYiZN_3pOFlLLQMct2Pih1?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1q1Uf_C_pl7FYeSIKOtEj1WsziOo7fgMI?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DHNT-UnkBM6NlZr8myRom8_C45bcZIF9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15bGS_Ky9YV7a8OpAt-W8CthVy4pNqyRO?authuser=0"}]}
