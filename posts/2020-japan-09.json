I rode clockwise around the lake from Oike park, stopping at various points to take in the sights, mostly of Fuji hanging in the background.\n\nAbout ¾ of the way around I reached the main lookout point on the lakeside, with a coffee shop and pretty much perfect views of Fuji, so I stopped and enjoyed a coffee while taking in the scenery!\n\nTo wrap up the day around Kawaguchiko by travelling up the ropeway to get a view of the lake and Fuji. This was nice, and gave a good view once up at the top.\n\nI returned the bike and figured out my route back to Tokyo - 5 trains in total, taking about 4 hours in the end! There was some great scenery along the way though - plenty of countryside with small villages and stations before the hussle and bustle of Tokyo again!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sRpUTKkUFIn7EUmzQurq2b25zgkFerpv?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/126ypHOyrS9zysviaVOfp7Fw06hwb6s4n?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1g7EZfE2hg-9b9LPZQxDfghfuanKcXO91?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FkbcgGYjtCGNs5JNwhNSKoyTwSqMuL7-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1407pVysGijYrqj_P9w42FMJJVef0Hufm?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lcZr9hJQmHoU2V00cu-cyoDy-0Vfrqmc?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mXCpig4l6-HkIxjksWAc2-gLunEQDZRv?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13hwPO5jHEUy9ygMh51s44WIpSBWZIgTx?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/108OjPI0dKMCXZmX-oJU0hRpdg43HeSte?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11pe0xO9IRl3G2MJlOr1pY9pKwKNsqvdl?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-kv48jlXZwIGVe-Md4Wx2WfL5j9HRpcj?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yelMooFX3sHGJVPP68UKDOl7XQ9sqEv_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VyPBFBW3R-LKejJOIScj4oxYgM0IrX3X?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vXrXboPFEBOySn5juL86iXLpsXy_72XE?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XK8pmWwzy0IgusnyInGzJ_3wHJt_sAes?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18Tsij2m7OZSBnhTemeSAUwlCst2dpODQ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SWauVUVlsxuXsqZbSc9S2cyssThF-vm6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jOCesRRFL2mAmykd6Uj1W9BL6lnmjUEm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GucjqmL44tD-NwwxOkAJJ66nfMfGrqED?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vMZpdMSNb4Grxf2bmcW_e_44ApAuTm5d?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19M7cuFGRLKXp33vikD3sukks8yH0v-h0?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m_8CDrAAr85JDmRCQPFYmcecEGVqHA_e?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mB-0RM0W4Xc18FT2rdIOaZhMAg1TpuuL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kv5KKvdyQV1pVLgkn7DedxeGTqjhPn3x?authuser=0"}]}
