Everyone was pretty keen to ride the bullet train one more time, so we decided to go to Ueno, aiming for the Tokyo National Museum.\n\nThe bullet train was a short ride to Tokyo station (around 15 minutes), but it was fun and comfortable again.\n\nA quick transfer to a local train and we a few stops put us in Ueno, where the first port of call was coffee! There are 2 really nice options in Ueno park, so we grabbed a table where there was one free and got our drinks. This was a very nice atmosphere - the day was pleasant, and sitting in a park having a coffee, taking in the sights and reminiscing about the trip was a fantastic way to spend some of our last day.\n\nWe had a couple hours to explore some of the national museum, which wasn't ages, but it gave enough time to work our way through 2 buildings at a steady enough pace. Seeing and reading about the historical artefacts, and the dating of some of them was really cool - so much history captured over thousands of years, and on display. The more \"modern\" exhibits were also fascinating - the intricate details of artworks and clothing over the ages, just awesome to see in person.\n\nWe wrapped up with enough time to get back and have some late lunch before heading to the airport. Before our transfer at Tokyo station again we ventured outside to see the building and get a sense of the scale of the station, then we were on one last bullet train ride back to the hotel area.\n\nLunch was in a nice restaurant on the walk back to the hotel, then it was time to collect our luggage and wait for the bus to the airport.\n\nPhew! It was a very busy two-and-a-bit weeks, but definitely interesting to experience the country in this different way, and it was great to share the experience with some family this time!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tcN-XUcuVCTX9dosuZqf35gyFx5zYJll?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jxJpuU8WQy4Pkmucn3Ptc5DmiMBOEks8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AgxAbF11xxrRTC0LlUB1lqjpz_9e9HzZ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16WrnRFXujqeE6Py3EHDPh00X1anD3Z58?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ysCb3kKfigork8w4Bm7dOAO2iXiLKNRJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1E1sUDwAPzZM-GX83r7wvK4HEj5ZLLQpq?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cDvoQDDvcyEugtzpX7o3z1CFDMAoYGLQ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hucgjAyC4jIR5tCzUS6xuSq4mTNr7j5E?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12DLXmTYq5VUSbbMfKR-oorguCuVZ0FtB?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/163w1j_IwATZq-gKJDoMKfjoMb5ft4KM6?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12snRTPV4a1RiXUJrsZr9XlmZ5Z0ZLlm5?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MvuUufWeKLEVpoQy08mg49-AjKKcp1rw?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DmGZUA5J1iaNkakHtlyDpOiN13vF-zRi?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/112oFZmqzg1hafBbp3gh-Vh6R--CQ1-WF?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ujhQqFxp8X2IIPibbatnoo-mUjTY2ZcM?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cQeDWviHitzdAzdZwUGzwkFLjEX2YypX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1P6ndh2qe6El-bvb6GnB0Q-bk1fUvFh7E?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UrPlcbOJutLQ7XWRijxTSBWIdyUJ4qnl?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YyL423gvq_aUddNmneY0BNDIkDSlqDIP?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WP74jYdMyGYNM6SbWXMVFzy5WMUAGA0V?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L-9JtqnhJBFGNrRwC_Bchz_KgNn4VqzX?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1s_h8MtSPLeErSBSwbAcOzq3bfEXZ-z2t?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dul5p8NNwSZsUayuutP6M6a_qhX_19_W?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xDrNbEjFBC6TFdJzr7xU-7HIcLVby8lL?authuser=0"}]}
