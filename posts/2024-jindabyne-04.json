Thredbo itself is a really neat little place - very different from other towns I've been to in Australia. I can see why it would be a lot of fun during Winter.\n\nA short very interesting ride up the chairlift to the start of the hike, and we were on our way. The scenery on the mountains without the snow is breathtaking. While the mountains themselves aren't all that tall or pronounced, the landscape is still very impressive in its own way. The hike itself was a little steep at times, but mostly just a reasonably lengthy trek (a little over 13km return).\n\nBefore the final hike around the mountain to reach the summit, we stopped for lunch and a toilet break. Mum got going before the rest of us as she was worried she mightn't make it and wanted to give herself more time. Thankfully all of us made it! The mountains a more rolling than peaks, but it was still great to see the views, and share the moment with family.\n\nGetting back down was a bit of a slog. Mostly easier, though there were a few steep enough uphill sections still, but the fatigue was setting in a little towards the end, so we were all pretty happy to reach the bottom again. Hot chocolate and coffee (and a treat cake / pastry) was our reward!\n\nVery much pleased to have done this hike now - was well worth the effort!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lzcN2d5wA8jrv8JzXavYCaNL9bWKPZcH?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KKh4bdOwVf65xjmbkh0Rbps9iqZYcrL7?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13jz---zVRXUAbFjiIRIFqKX7097jfZdP?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aN4nGPB_32mlt5zMbJSmOSwhoWkMGhdt?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a2F6nppEdlD-gWcnk7MNszbeiWWhf4zN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1G0-37jY7ecaz5r9twjFbJqvCKtfSU_cL?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yW5VvrOuDQfHNTcxK566UQNEPxjyz_QT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11n6UIc_NJA0ecQETtHgX5rNfLI4b5e4W?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1W3NFjSEqx0T2rAtOpUF2x07_e1DduL7_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dGrkoMfwYbxe7DG0eZ9aqeuXhEAAFq17?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ybt77nJcGWjySlsSas58QamvtMPGD5g8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1L_L6pf4AGhjzazjSEEQIHUIErMTW-1Pv?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gfQg86ZKwDG71-tK5lBDd7UcDQi7Eg6B?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1I1ywDzyXk_2cfArQkvBMi4ZxdknnY20o?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LVNEIr9mYGhg4OwbO7cyxQWL8N5Qd6jE?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lvkK3rmLo9RHuSfVLkBqLy5QrFnRaImK?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1k9TgGC_RD1Ynvfq1rg3zaGonwoL-0uJy?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jo6D8gC6ydNO2-aPo1GVXsyfOec5HP39?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iQ6uoWnXNF7KqM57TsI81CDJGPMwCKfS?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TnOzmheihH9fVt5_4s2NuXn1fsP7N5ny?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PbkkYpJKX5Rx71gxzClFhxEvklcEudG2?authuser=0"}]}
