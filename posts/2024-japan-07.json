{"id":"2024-japan-07","collection":"2024-japan","date":"2024 December 2","title":"Kyoto - Matcha + Byōdōin + Arashiyama","content":"Today was a jam-packed day, and all of it was awesome!\n\nFirst we headed to Uji, a lovely smaller town just out of Kyoto. Here we learnt about matcha making from a man who married into a family who've been making it for several generations! Afterwards we all had a go at preparing some for ourselves (just the tea making part). This was a great experience all around, and the shop and owners were great to have a chat to.\n\nOur next stop was a short walk away at Byōdōin temple with its Phoenix Hall. These grounds were nice, but the temple itself being around 1000 years old is hard to comprehend. Seeing the preserved artwork on the walls inside a very nicely presented temple that's that old is hard to put into words.\n\nThere was also a museum we walked through with artefacts associated with the temple and the beliefs surrounding it - this was also incredible to see and ponder given the age.\n\nNext we were back into Kyoto, straight to Arashiyama bamboo forest. Unfortunately this place is overrun by tourism now, but still is a neat experience.\n\nGetting out of the main street of Arashiyama, we headed over the river to find a simple lunch before trekking up to the monkey park (see next post). The lunch was tasty, but sitting near the river's edge, taking in the sights, and enjoying the day together was quite special.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1J5LaPzravEiPiPFv629vmbg-cb1f-chA?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dCiHPFvS1CfPXvN0hvcNsSF4kWN9cw6f?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aIhLAhp7eaghZFdGkOb9yfX6CwTXha2b?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OhWnCBV11sZtoPim6YnROVju7LmslDpp?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PuDmwGefgNHzzTlTwRf5CGEtyZDKII8D?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LJHhCHD18ys2Kr4yQGG-IGWio4jhD5Yn?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ib8VYMBf1pPqzTGkYA6BUxfKU9-wqdwz?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CVPnCgt82NHC9868vpdrk8ePqhwrNqZN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i8Td0JRT13uWeu67OwdMdrAKZipiUaN0?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Et2VWaq23gKl7txjOs5qBK1xFjlRD8Xv?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pJa9Pr4FSi-jfAC6em1UD0GaSnp5eLL4?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pX52h_YeNCKkyfJJbd7GzqKmYy4nicq7?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-d1tuVsWRwd9OE-d9xrZRZfoBNNo6Wce?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17RBto-1GDzhTRzATY5HxrfEi7Xx3nfQ8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HIYirVIrgRzanNkkBgN17pEMYPCuuvdw?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16Ds5K5mKLV76G87qcDaqO3Uz6wW1VpXO?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BJOLpJUFDUojsHb4R5KObjEMjSYPPlNb?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Qno0027pc9ZnCHxBcxLTeT3Z90zWDC8N?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yT44zmRD4KdW1lIBrkNj0St0vV5djVg9?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eBZ4LyxVcuguezPaXU6fEVEnzx9uOXcG?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xbXibqO6fhpyMrvqNGzZWUJefJU4ANnT?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17RoE-ANlpvdjPn55AONugo3M3Hsr2MTh?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ajjsEqmTszXRtf7wazM3Zl-D5-RZtwtC?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rgNNWQhN_kUcrq4FpJLEm3Yl85_i4AEG?authuser=0"}]}
