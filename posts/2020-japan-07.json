{"id":"2020-japan-07","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 10","title":"Nikko → Tokyo (part 3) - Ueno, Akihabara","content":"Two trains later I was back in Tokyo from Nikko.\n\nI got off the train in Ueno, so decided to spend a little time in Ueno park which is right next to the station. This is a large park with a variety of things to see, but the 2 stand outs were: a single plum tree in partial bloom; and the temple in the middle of the park’s lake.\n\nI didn’t realise, but plum trees bloom in the late winter, before apricot then cherry trees bloom (Tristan and Naoko filled me in on this!). They might start to show more and more while I’m here, which would be nice!\n\nThe next day was a public holiday, and I had already seen a few places appearing to prepare for it. The temple in the middle of the lake was similar, though also had a lot of stalls setup on the side of the path leading to it, suggesting a lot of people would be showing up! Made for a different look to a place I had seen before.\n\nLast for the day was Akihabara. This was a visit mostly to use up a little more time, as I still had a little bit to spare before heading back to the house. Not much has changed here that I could notice - still as crazy, loud, and bright as ever. Still, was fun to experience the crowds and atmosphere again briefly.\n\nAnd with that, a long but very interesting day was pretty much done!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aJ_DX5rckC78E9DuTp8YoTLn1DJM9oWZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vy4uNtEM6d61mw4vxOv8jvvRm-7Voxgx?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/133P8aihvtPZLfa_UW8FFHdCm_oNicRKM?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FRSNwQu1iSOBNL72kGt4UcLqi6B9dyen?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yMZc8r5FktpjmByioQxDmbvBN1Y1wqcN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KzfyicFxTPvlnCSwb5Okg5TCQLKyejPH?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EehSkjkR_eH2P6p5EaW1cvF06Xg7JybX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IWVUN7YFWv3ho6N5rVV9W-7k9dnnKlpM?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1b6UPdGs8IpuMuvTFtVMoYSVKgOVLkGY8?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SxHpi4BKAHmaXd1ifK5A2KEDrAU4tVyg?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xtSOSwZLXeNe1sjvuvLZPc-bH49hFa28?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Khv55f6ubwyR-v_pQNU2brYMglRbvk7u?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1szX9BHSnR5XRWyJ1OEYqfC14nucV0NRZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nhnJFamCnCId4dDN0i_HtxxriGdCNYxs?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1h3aP9QyheRnjCLI8SvR9dH2U87wmFE2j?authuser=0"}]}
