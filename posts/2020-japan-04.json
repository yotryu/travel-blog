{"id":"2020-japan-04","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 9","title":"Tokyo → Nikko - Hikarigaoka park, travel","content":"This morning after a bit of a later start, Tristan and I went for a bike ride to their local park - Hikarigaoka. It’s only 5 minutes away by bike to the main area, and the place is quite large! Heaps of footpaths to walk or ride down, heaps of gardens and trees (including cherry blossoms which would be insane in bloom), and heaps of open space where families were having fun together, and others were practicing instruments! Oh and there are various sporting fields / grounds where kids were competing and practicing.\n\nWe rode around about half the park, then walked around a small section to see some areas a bit closer before we finished up sitting and chatting on seats near our bikes. Had a very friendly and community sort of feel to the whole place which made it a nice pleasant way to spend a little time.\n\nAfter we got home, I got myself ready to travel to Nikko for the night. This took a while with all the trains required to get to the town, but was easy enough. Saw some nice countryside and small townships on the local train, but was quite surprised with Nikko itself once I arrived and got off the train - it looks and feels kind of like a snow mountain town! Very pleasant surroundings and the town itself is neat and nicely laid out for tourists.\n\nNot many photos as my timing of arrival was just as the sun started to disappear behind the mountains, so better photos tomorrow.\n\nAccommodation for the night was in a ryokan called “Annex Turtle Hatori-An” - a very nice smallish place with a great view out the bedroom window! And the owner was a lovely lady who lives in the place (she made sure to point this out when explaining attractions on a map) and did a fantastic job giving a tour around the whole building to show and explain all the things available. Was a positive first impression, and that continued for my stay.\n\nDinner was “neapolitan spaghetti” from one of few restaurants in the area near the ryokan, and it was delicious! I wasn’t expecting anything amazing, but felt like a change of food for one meal so was willing to accept it might be average. I don’t know what herbs and spices were in the “sauce” for the dish, but it was so full of flavour, and the price was great too. Definitely a pleasant surprise to wrap up the day!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tgacvU1Q1ohtuzEhmBv9WeCi3MeM15sN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eL2GtctXq0Xkkar2xJBhKKrG-dEjQsLe?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gxTtlyoQjTQtrHeAbJzVBlpIvaQebAIm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Sd5lMmhCRexMLbkhcC6n4Qg99vwF4ESU?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zR13buxhjcWhyjNaA9Zr_KqpS2HvHzX2?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LvSafrD61JeVkjzTJ42BCnSOdYK4Tb4m?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/174iHojYdVqqv-9c-2Blna_LsBVWH51gH?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1h9dG9AzQVCCmXZo-x8R7GHMLQlwbr2tp?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cCcbIwTg4pd7ovFCAidOcI5EDlUeK8LT?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CvkN7GBNNOeOl2Dcj92mbc_Q4ZOr7bxA?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iCSEEGsR5odhCX3X_8lVHfcKdUlUZfzJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OA2BVCvhDCwGv-T_uL86WCKh0ffaFtbh?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CXdg0mMY1JpSLUwcqElsR1-znznNnZ06?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1x7t0YJ2_nmNkjK_YC7GFA72Hb0Ydvgg1?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oD27TGszz_iK8xJ_MVDQisZhHVex-RxN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uCsfUIUhsQ5iEFV8Viqwnm1BDxmfwbm9?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1K0a56FsMapamlgwemRkjIIPacCWoXcre?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CumlQL_JDkPO6RIe2wL_3cIE9BFlIVpI?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_H32MSj4LqsWMXoi2mgCL19OzSJcoTet?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/112wT_UTsX8Mpg1b-8YeYAQYT_dQQSYm2?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iChkdQbNhL1GqSqqLcZjLjJoI3n2Rlz-?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1D-BBPY4c4VSKMA4zHdZufUjJ9_Yvohyb?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1spLDFdjnt2FLq74Ffl8tLBAUFfg0B4fY?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KSjys5kH7x-5oRiYvXPjuI7nbQz5jGmi?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1U-JPPeLq-kcUAdL4Jd33WzCyM-0o2EUa?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CgVhfRf4BZk52FX5GGWXhx701FOwm2SM?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gNDQ6yHhy7dQG6XIHUPBekr4BTN19Jpq?authuser=0"}]}
