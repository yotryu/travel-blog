{"id":"2020-japan-13","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 16","title":"Yamagata → Tokyo - Yakiniku","content":"Bit of a quiet day today - half the day was travelling back to Tokyo from Yamagata.\n\nOnce I got back to the house, I chatted with Tristan and Naoko for a bit before Tristan suggested we go out to see if a small shrine garden near them had plum blossoms out yet. There were some, but it wasn’t quite time for them yet - hopefully before I leave I’ll get to see a bunch out!\n\nPlayed some games while we had the chance before dinner, then headed out for yakiniku (BBQ, over coals in this case). This was great! We had all you can eat, which is time limited to 90 minutes from when you first request food. Food requests were done with a tablet device, then after a short wait, staff would bring the plates of food out for us to cook!\n\nThe whole dinner was an experience, and I enjoyed it for sure. Plenty of good food, a bit of chatting, and lots of cooking!\n\nWas a nice change of pace, and filled me up ready for my next day out!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19X-pCY8ZvZouUB0nLFeRLRCkIVWuKiMX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZW-3LSc5J-tVK42WjLzVexjD44zpz7YL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MFW9ziUv8Lyj0PbsC2VMcY99oW-PwJlW?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hJXmrgGoEazQJIurjkcIukjN4U0JNlRE?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YrB0qSDrowzXzEVt6QTw5VmA-v4LXjur?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1f8-Yy3QtBpB4KHnbE8T42f0KmdRdR9bK?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NhvlodxChEhJnWncE6u8vAsQDnSQI0yy?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jmonegBxx_wT_0gAwB5Z4r7wy0E_xlV9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-j2ncvmZ5pTNZU9bO8lUGtsAzRVg_iOK?authuser=0"}]}
