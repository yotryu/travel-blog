This was heaps of fun to watch, especially with the interesting low cloud hanging around.\n\nLuge was hilariously good fun as well. With 7 people trying to overtake and race, chaos was pretty much the only way to describe it - one of us slipped and scraped an arm on the track, and another completely flipped their luge at the end! I think we were all exhausted just from the amount of laughing caused by the chaos!\n\nDinner was Hikari Japanese again (for 5 of us), and it was delicious again.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1klGu6XCB0D5PcnrSvMlliVJOBSHWD18j?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1V050KioDrU6Q39vVS3Cgn8vHjfhH4PSo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Wazex9aqvzHhzA7oYkVha-Hk6dl92M6N?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1beHHEe6lhNpZwRXrfEF5z_pfR5jxClLo?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zC0tiECR4RHo5WdpyT2yEXWSHejQQiRP?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KNcMUbsBj5EgDsFcP-z2io1IZQOgz6mB?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HVUPpQswKcaG9SuA607xYL9r808xWXdJ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14drXvyYFLa2x_JwF2osLLirjR1UFNB3w?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19V8emnDeY4U1nBpUkn4u1mkD-IFuEy3C?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GJkANSYDy7XIyvxURSOUCMK65M5xNhpn?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12nZAalz2YD0y-KVb0H9GnPbIzjLmDDe1?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10zix6yuC9fVBwypy8mtWiijJLSpfbEg9?authuser=0"}]}
