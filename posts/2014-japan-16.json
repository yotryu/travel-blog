We had intended to hire some bikes and ride here, but there just wasn’t enough time unfortunately.The grounds of this temple are the standout - heaps of interesting things to see, and all very unique compared to the other temples we’ve seen so far!\n\nThe afternoon was spent travelling back to Tokyo and getting ourselves to the hotel. The evening was spent in Akihabara again - Trent and Jules were keen for some skill tester action and Jules wanted to find a GoPro pole so he can hold it away from him while he’s boarding (looking back at him).\n\nSurprise dinner though! We went to a really nice place called Gohan - Baru and Dining (that was how it was written - Japanese literal roman version of “bar” in this case). The food and drinks were incredible! We all had 2 cocktails each - all of them were stupidly tasty - some tapas and a main dish. Tapas (first photo) was garlic toast, squid fritters (calamari) and rice croquette in mozzarellla cheese - these really set the tone of what to expect from the rest of the meals. Mains were bolognese for Jules, diavola pizza for Trent, and roasted duck with “today’s sauce” for me - we all raved about our dishes, but I can only speak for the duck - it was outstanding! All reasonably priced as well - this whole meal cost us about AU$30 each (2 drinks, an entree and a main all of crazy high quality)! I had the chance to tell them the meal was delicious once again - huge smile from the guy I told, and we got a massive bow as we left the restaurant in the lift - his body was a right angle because of the quality of the bow! It really makes a difference to your dinning experience when the people who work there care so much about what they’re doing to react so dramatically to appreciation of their work :)\n\nTomorrow we’re off to Hakuba! Forecast is -5˚C maximum! Should be fun.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_4fBTJcgjBe9Uno4lGx5OdnVq_-kRp_T?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QY07yq8Dg3Xpy0BtLuT6m9qwSYaZL7Tf?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QF666MDxls2Bf3DzJ7AeEsDzIROp5uvZ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1unXuIXTxPoduTbYhNAMmZaQ28tF2cyHX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OBxwIxeTQbLI9BxbKWiD8ddC7bas6gis?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13PWayjb0gb_7ECcW3KH5c7H89sSgB1bi?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Dc-P6zoAZ4-HjLcfhTjGJ2l54mZrX1gF?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UgD4H-70RhmXl4TcOiGq7SDIx8VZ4XVL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CNgm3kg5MjJA0nMvNgY7TsRsxnxW77Jg?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xTy97Wwiasjvy45uI8Ewlubr2Y6z63aL?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bq00Jdbqp7NOY9zOdivGJ49x75PEvpgE?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1x0pFQ5zpgzVSTaEl94VmqcwrKY_vGwCY?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GAGKUp0_p6OyvYiOVW-hD0tHwKKB3xKl?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vNaeooVA6rblTN_wEB5SdEUh3YDqIxkJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MROmDcYQlVGgXeMl48INkCY0u4ByFJrm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1qyFRb_NPRKjA7bizy3AK84PzBP7kUncX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZN7QFep9V-5OdBaoRi6_9ibqnoVcvQ4L?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Hf3wxc7DXqDsd6_-hHCIR-AdPkQZeTuT?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HtO3WqBiKYZaR5pJYnIO1dTuAP9AeG87?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BkVIWKzBDpIpJWCOGUug_HlY5XWEqiiS?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Y-hmKj_yeihIrnDtJeckNQJzQbK-J7TP?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Q4TK5jKkEY92NRojebdAizjokVWoIMG2?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19Abzqeo9xf6crsJVV5b2_ZJtJ9g14hRN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rkBBbrHQoziXfB-9W-pDVVCEdXGYT84o?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vcDvmFl4yjkljq1-1wdf1nbRRk89aOtI?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1G8wbDrOL5qOw3Zd1EgJO8PIlpyUe6epc?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14b8NBMLi689FwUj8Pz1YRQjIRRTj7cSm?authuser=0"}]}
