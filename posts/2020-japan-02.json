{"id":"2020-japan-02","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 7","title":"Tokyo Day 1 - Imperial Palace, Odaiba","content":"Today was a work day for Tristan, so I left at the same time to go on a day of solo ‚Äúexploring.‚Äù\n\nFirst was a visit to the Imperial Palace grounds. This was mainly due to it being easily accessible on the same subway from Tristan‚Äôs place, but also because it was early and would actually be open üòâ.\n\nIt still looks as neat and tidy as I remember it, though because I stuck around for a little while, I got to see a procession of horses from the palace walk around the grounds for a bit. I suspect this was practice or training, as they stuck to a fairly simple circuit. Seeing the line of horses being followed by cars of people who would jump out to clean up droppings was particularly amusing - the devotion to cleanliness on display!\n\nAfter that unexpected morning, I decided to head to Odaiba - Tristan mentioned the Olympic rings were on display in the bay, and visible from Odaiba, so why not check it out.\n\nI walked the length of the main Odaiba strip along the shops on the waterfront to a viewing spot for the rings, nabbed some photos, then went to grab lunch - Japanese curry!\n\nBefore heading back to the house, I read about an attraction called ‚ÄúteamLab borderless‚Äù which was in the area, so decided to check it out. It was a bit pricey, but was a very interesting experience! It‚Äôs a ‚Äúdigital art museum,‚Äù with very interesting use of walls, open space, mirrors, and perspective to show the various moving pieces. Quite easily spent an hour or so there, and definitely enjoyed the experience!\n\nDinner was ramen and gyoza at a place ~5 mins away from the house - this was a nice meal, though noodles still fill me up too easily and I couldn‚Äôt finish it all‚Ä¶","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mXadXtS2XJMOjhnnoWG-XlaeLummj0ds?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tgtpKOh010IlnagSUHVJZnFms5VJ88lp?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eqc0o4WxAE0zbSgeYS9oZTq5wYyNmn1B?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1moUiO3kdbwsiGPRxgyoeH2tD0sa_isV4?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13l10BiSr32cTyQGk1-8XQFCNt33emMoR?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B_nC24HJHfY-LPiUdaAka6qzkCiugu0J?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19T6E8B0OT70-nN5FQwwZ5ZefM2E2kLmd?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wt9ReEnhJJZjh7cRIYF7Lib73yTuvQse?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rT0ZCbMIWTHziLajAdQPKcPBt4OY-GU0?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sHCmshf2VbPoa89Uv1oUlBbL16c_NrSr?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15ld5s0jzBq2RqZ621LqvmR0DGwh6l--A?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xVko6WnUmjD-IwXGweDpye-o3XM4y51y?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1inonl66ctGtpUP3lud-Xff2poIioLe1i?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F_KojnjgoOGebpzsUDinjswGEowzJ9CL?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17U__5SjVfSGvLFcD19mhS_uzOyCXQQQ2?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jmBxrkW9FRpC7Q3v-HOwQzx-y7WMWN8n?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1G-G4czgQFRNYcmKHn-5bzIjA2V4KcRye?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10zvkFUoC-KIWwJ5TSu5GMw9e6f45MrOt?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mwezKyxR_4ykUlHObJ-DBtfkpqoE9Ph5?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CTvuzB62RS7DC4T8TD2Tu5KaUChTHpeB?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WyOq526dYq_HwYKVNkbpbt280Vc1JEpa?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZaEirgMQZJBC001oV9oY6nKOHmZWzEZg?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kI5E7DobuaAJwVZvVx1dSU-xM2NvYHuZ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JYwqtRytBKPSArL2MmI6mKNWkKGUHeJp?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1v1NhIs1sz6GcvB8lfEWT8tdVqrrltOi7?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Ibzp8CSJPNuYM0_8QJBkcrbJ3IILczSe?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-U96E4y1xzZClj2jDcKa1OVZST3ZCoGH?authuser=0"}]}
