{"id":"2020-japan-17","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 19","title":"Takayama → Kyoto - Hida folk village","content":"This morning started with a nice cafe breakfast in a small place just across the street from the train station. A very thick piece of toast with butter and strawberry jam, and coffee. This was nice to have - I haven’t eaten toast since I arrived haha.\n\nAfter checking out of the hotel, I walked to the Hida folk village - an “open air museum” showcasing traditional buildings, tools, and general way of life for people in the region from many centuries ago.\n\nThis place was very interesting! Really unique things on display inside many of the buildings, and the buildings themselves with various roofing materials and styles. Was a relaxed way to learn a bit more about how things worked in the region a long time ago, before modern conveniences.\n\nOnce I finished at the folk village, I had enough time to revisit the historic district to see how it looked without snow. I enjoyed the walk through the street again, but I think the snow made for a more novel experience.\n\nThe whole afternoon was travelling to Kyoto, and this took longer than anticipated due to train delays in the first leg which made me have to catch a later Shinkansen for the second leg. Still, not a big problem, just meant a little more time travelling than expected!\n\nDinner was from a small restaurant not too far from the hotel. I had a pork cutlet with miso sauce set (with rice, miso soup, tofu, and shredded cabbage). This was really tasty, well-priced, and fresh! Ordering was done with a vending machine (thankfully with pictures for all the menu options), then the staff would take a piece of the receipt for the kitchen, and use the other part to identify you when your food is ready! It’s a neat system that works well and gave me no trouble. I was pleased with the effort, and the delicious food that resulted!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1atZSsZFvmf2s3rEQ237-ryXhdU71SXi8?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1U6oQUm9VJvX64B3kSxMTbTOAyuuj0Yco?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eHIRVVGbskP0mPBEOPykR3DtQ64QOYTP?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aIhGcmQ2rnt4dxotmMzEP8ydLqG2DVtT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xMocWsuLjc6ut1iBMLUrS4MZPty9aqi6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JFnz7cj0HI2Jq6BoJLt6b_frDNQHPZpG?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aq6KUvSEKKfmHJZ21aMjJYLU9NIy2fb6?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18HfSAI5NCi-Digp25JxhwHB2n0BsA-Xv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oMtxztBEvK2ttcKTu5EukMc6IbxBN_ck?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kpMpn1SFkiIuAQx7u9HibRcA6xRwlPHY?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t8Y9rSRwttPedsuo1K26w3e4gd_erPVo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XywIe9uKNITwAsHulXHi4iq7Fw5u442F?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1E86RYbVHMrLzLYRAaZ_z69uJmHsYCIrN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12OJAd7ljE11GEjM8Iy7p6OZvfPy4fkS4?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/170Oz2HmGYHygRJMPmp_wI0Zs2GeoOG-C?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PRTPNaYAXlsMTO6CkGUmWZ7nokCm1Fap?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12SrSQJ3gpVqEVKOSIhSeN2kMQZ8fOKS6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZOy6CTwQoV4Y5U7dZjn8Eom1Jn6W47DQ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HO1rc7gW-5CtyWW_4sP2AhZAThssn8Mo?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oawMOxXTTytVmuw1-JFWCi7QBZepUm0p?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RuighnVDsDkN6JoeMM5ekxXroC5KGfC_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PXiGLPJVjmVkBVEw5p0FPEqeQAb5omdM?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zQ6aIGJtVr87UjkMEANcVrpoUaSaPinI?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BApqYNo3AzDQi0TiGLa63D5J5BG7xohc?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wiyjII2RzI98SrTJYlOzICEnNTjx3AQ8?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FqEVKoAExePiHWEH1w7evbbcQya-tztT?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1duHP8gVtQdZmXA5-rbgIKol-7IWWVUro?authuser=0"}]}
