{"id":"2020-japan-11","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 14","title":"Haguro → Yamagata - Ginzan Onsen","content":"After all the train rides, it was time for a change - catching a highway bus from Tsuruoka to Yamagata! This was actually the fastest way by many hours (trains would run so infrequently that there would be long transfer waits), so time for something abit different!\n\nAs it turned out, riding the bus was quite enjoyable. The roads were all smooth and comfortable, even through all the mountains, and the views were quite remarkable! A decent amount of snow, plenty of bare trees, and a few frozen rivers / lakes. It really was a nice surprise of a journey to my next stop.\n\nActually riding the bus was easy enough, though I did forget to collect a ticket on entering the bus (should have not been first…), which resulted in a friendly person alerting me and helping sort it out haha!\n\nOnce I arrived in Yamagata city, I left my luggage at the hotel (check in was somewhat later) and grabbed some lunch.\n\nI had decided today would be the day to get to Ginzan onsen - I had the time, and knew it would be a little trickier of a trip than others, so wanted to get on with it haha. This involved a train ride and a bus ride, though the bus was a little more challenging to sort out as the stops and signs outside had no English this time. Using some online help (and paying attention to the crowds), I figured out the right bus and made it there.\n\nGinzan onsen is a hot spring town built around an old silver mine (the name is literally translated to “silver mountain hot spring”), but is now a tourist spot for sightseeing during the day, and hot spring / inn stays during the night.\n\nThe small town is unique and impressive enough during day time, but it really comes to life at night (I stayed until the last bus back to the station at 6:20pm) - as the sunsets, all the ryokan and restaurants light up, and guests staying in the town start to emerge to enjoy the atmosphere. It reminded me so much of “Spirited Away” that I assume this sort of place had to be some kind of inspiration for the movie.\n\nGetting back to the station was interesting as well! There were 2 busses on the way, so I assumed that would be the case on the way back, but I was conscious that they could be busy, so I got to the bus stop to line up a little early. This was a good choice! The queue was already long, and in the end, I was on the second bus, and some people were left to find their own way back (probably by taxi)! This all meant the bus was a bit late, which meant I missed the train I was hoping to catch, putting me onto a later local train back to Yamagata! This was all fine, just unplanned and slightly longer than I had hoped.\n\nStill, I’m glad I got out to Ginzan, and today as well - tomorrow will be much less activity for a nice change!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RedUFsA30AEGI1Ep9yELnmcPXUe7i7cC?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n1vj9L7pQjZ0YjQlz1y1h9jp8xjRkyBG?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1FptkdhnW_pscgydVWyc6pjet6Gm_FA7v?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lIasK0UZt7phTWW1J9i8rKdEI5w-xVF1?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JEjrpYiaCcAfCpD-fo-Ljmcu-J5h-cp5?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/102YrO_RIXTtFwPypLDZjOiBLV6qEL_BY?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F-aFOQ_U6EwE7YFKPBRIUJcvgL-PLfsO?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1z-Tq5D_TN0q1gCu7RyCni3WDYK4uSims?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1arXZt4lf75KPbK1p2wgdbsQMYedDZTCn?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KnOtPgehBFP9aohr7F0UWVBoUaTZnfrN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Dg4t793JPpDUQz7fHsYyZ4TiS2zUKF39?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YPmZkMiO5Ugm842dRiF0dn56kVK0ALvt?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1l0IpinLQ9T9aJpEB4-T7q7aaGqt-TL1l?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BTvAr-413T6Yt9jOXx3BHWka2aT1mPKj?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13kYDlHXScQvRDIjzsa7Pjpq73UkQ1IJD?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DRVjIOHoCDu4nKsi3swTiSG6khFL98vJ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EARduWYXn3YDQICrqL1GBKC8cLIgk_G-?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XYqBOefKz3jcrjWa9XiNjyq_xhNYjVia?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wC6-agW1GPNvBzIKzmlzpO1tZRa7j_51?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/14O3b65aibBDcUJ4M48VzWqOLFGxTgGrx?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19AVFKvRTw5F-kQMEr-3fZzuLEWjQAXCT?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11oaB4P0ePYAmmLEOWTZnpxdEv_uGFL0H?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1idxXveMhm8kZRMwO6x64wkZPccTWQSXV?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r01XsSspkRSVf7UgizDNRgUF_yrXgK_V?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cAdoOB28zWbR9Io2aVdAKU-eYC5l_yPp?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1i0MXKZyC08yrv4oEutWXx1omhUtivSF6?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CBokphd8qbriIaMfzHc1-Z3d1YxqBYo8?authuser=0"}]}
