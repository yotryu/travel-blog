We made our way over the bridge and found a coffee shop - a most important stop before we could continue! This place was quirky and slow, looking like it was recently renovated and the owners / staff were in no hurry haha. It was fun, and the coffee was strong, making for a nice unique experience.\n\nAfter the coffee stop, we continued our way towards the ropeway up the mountainside where we then walked to a castle perched on top. This castle was much smaller than Himeji, and had a small exhibition inside showing traditional weapons and armour mostly. While neat, the main attraction were the views from the top - looking out over the city with its winding river to the sea in the distance was really cool.\n\nWe made our way back to the bus which then took us to a mountain rest stop which specialised in traditional \"bandit\" dishes - most notably chicken with a teriyaki glaze cooked on a skewer over fire. The whole place was awesome! The property was nestled in amongst the mountains with shops, buildings and sprawling seating in the area behind the entrance - it was such a unique and beautiful place to enjoy a lovely meal.\n\nAfter lunch we were off to our next hotel in Fukuoka, all the way onto a different island (Kyushu).","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wP-VosPRBI5GLqs2AHim7l6Z1JM4Z4VF?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16LrRHIOI4TstYyadxY0bUttQ_UA8NACo?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KKndj1r7cczBrrT8wJ-b4OTQmAlDtzTt?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GkXTSU6naxj0zAEXO2Ffv5t5tzCxtHIw?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1crcqBhzE6I9sl4AAobIVs5knglwgITV-?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fZawYW3ZsHLVkN4X8MMJ5iVEB7i1llYD?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1J_5r4aQrev0mnTJ5riD0kwRwUjzy2zns?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1PtBXI8Wt3HI45bbI-B5xxUKzt3p1gFRd?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1c2v1Jp4CTgDs4ycldt4N9-DE55MXj6UE?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ppw_K0f2Ef3-OVhxnu-0yg2mhAhM7xfM?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JeT-vYiF5igS2s25lp5g4x3bMsPXgsbV?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12ONDB_oidfmCq1JmsodUSnVm5LF5cBSc?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oOaS__LB5deknDJ3P_ZGnl6zk-7Ge89f?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m_9zcSA3uIxAOODfWQExJ9SDbkOUdyRc?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1l_Cp4ob1f8psw51LBqr_Q_sbomxFyr-u?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1IGiewMrYGzI96S7M-Tuld1IwP5osYZhT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fiPMTDlV2Dit20-aQ1tuoDubE2jAZtv-?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UJrP0E4GAiP_YFSaX9gGnfJYgvr4oEuJ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/116xg_BNXrrKA0_5nlXEBFBukKNbG-XbN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CvNZNm2g-HKqwHPqvyCva5FLlBWu9m6a?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-Opg8qk7HQiYyxSHRuWlLNdoll4VHZ7n?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vgfhSJAOCqq8GIsZ5a-k5NGrZe4pgsIE?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NZ0-cG91NCFxEBsl-7faTyNrVIcTRWy8?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1W1CKadBGIfuB7i8I_6CYH581iPQ4W6vl?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Z-fNEpNgzxNPCZpeDV1fEahD2POSnJEX?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1luODWEe-xiaYJedzvs-3N2P12I2LDdVZ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Piq3iP9lssUMKsM_Ff28E9lFp_60XSut?authuser=0"}]}
