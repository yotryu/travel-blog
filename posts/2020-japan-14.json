{"id":"2020-japan-14","collection":"2020-japan","date":"2020 February 17","title":"Tokyo - Kamakura (Part 1)","content":"Today was a spare day in Tokyo, so I decided to make the trip to Kamakura, a smallish place on the coast about an hour south of Tokyo.\n\nThe main attraction is the giant Buddha at Kotoku-in, but there are also plenty of temples and shrines to see as well.\n\nA few things surprised me about Kamakura and made me very pleased I spent the day there!\n\nFirst was the sweets / shopping lane just off the main station - I only tried a matcha ice cream (which was actually quite tasty), but the area was filled with neat little shops and plenty of people that it just had a fun vibe to it.\n\nAt the end of the lane was Tsurugaoka Hachimangu, a fairly large temple / grounds. This was impressive enough with some large structures throughout, though it didn’t have much to set it apart from others I’ve seen.\n\nNext I walked to the main beach, and to my surprise, it actually had a lot of sand! It was quite windy, so the water itself was choppy and uninviting, but that didn’t stop a handful of keen kite surfers from enjoying the day! And that was another surprising thing about the town - it has quite a multicultural and surf-town feel which gave it a unique charm I haven’t experienced in Japan. The town felt welcoming and laid-back while still having plenty of traditionally Japanese things as well.\n\nThe day was so filled with excellent stuff, so check part 2 for the rest!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hPeBcSDBTWxz72V1XrnHrmnPqsDyy9ur?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uyJEo50Hzfm5X3ESNWUd8P_xeCFAR1dP?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BFN5qpHiJBv1qVAeGd2peesfD8hMA8dd?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JqdRwdBurQg-E8YCswpeBbbxcXYuWQvo?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XnL6RYWw1RuXGehnOQbVSx3Bx4gISsmw?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1o6LEaaWXXzkRv3bbJuC8i57Jn3RSUBM_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17pM-1ckWFX9ru1fvOP19ISsJDccaT2EI?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1N2JUAqvmLrxUTKSE1EpcoyNof0WJHUEP?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1A_2vUGhaShTwqYz9xEea-JhrJVdzd9Ux?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iIQriuhPHvIYLh3KUt0iCb3TnsNfUYal?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hTBk6afvnKQxxfoM-EuQpyVv7nhIp1dN?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TMEVmNJrd8NvSdBtolSRL_l4g7LOMMig?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HLuoeZaaID2Rt-ZZP1XcJil9pmEwiVBt?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1fxnO5uvC-D36u2A7K3_7T7tUFpGH2MGg?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jEamY23Xqnc1KykU03dAxcPemL0ZWjyh?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18_E_To-XYS8M0fD2OnT6PooawZPn4wtY?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HINH4aUrUAXUngtQsZF9WpXaONxzJLe_?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pZcd-NqNpECUngOxitPWrYw2nHz7TLas?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HG1wCGgUL315CUYdgdrnERJGzsPqrOhg?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SpNWpK6bEaK2JIK1xE3aTX-IGw9pxl7l?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uf39p7UJbuC0AZmAZ2GKbmY-lrnqn7rv?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Y3qBOOMDJUP2WOCqnLM8qK7HXOPkPNmU?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nRJag0cyqdYo3eYuooqh1aRR-RxqPU2p?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15S7lSXAKtZrG2DZpxl65bMOarauGM_WY?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NwHhYmqeeidy5yJeAwcvuVE23PsceHgb?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QOrzN9CuhWzKbPrvZaXPmoU5w5JBfiW7?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1AXJjARqR1Q-Qn1ZTFq8EzA1z0LvJJG9_?authuser=0"}]}
