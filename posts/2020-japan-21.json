I wanted to check this place out because I had read it has lots of plum blossom trees, and since they have been starting to bloom while Iâ€™ve been in the country, I thought it might be a good place to see them!\n\nAs it turns out, there is a whole garden filled with many varieties of plum blossoms, but I was about a week early - next weekend was advertised for a festival (I think). It looked like the trees were maybe half in bloom, which was still an impressive sight! I opted not to bother with the garden though (1000 yen entrance fee was too steep), and instead admirred the blossoms in the free grounds, and from a distance in the garden. Still, it gave a good idea of how extraordinary the flowers must look when they are all out in bloom.\n\nNext, it was only a few more bus stops to Kinkaku-ji (the gold pavilion), which I donâ€™t think I had been to before. This place was busy, but nicely laid out that things were still orderly. The main building was very impressive and unique, and I particularly liked how the gardens and pond adjoining the building seemed to make it all the more interesting to see. The rest of the gardens / the walk through the area was nice and straight forward.\n\nLastly I wanted to get back to Kiyomizu dera, mostly because it was free, and reconstruction work had finished on it. The shopping street leading to the entrance was pretty busy, but that gave the place a fun energy - plenty of people browsing shops and trying local snacks and treats. The temple complex itself was more impressive than I remember, possibly because the sun was out this time, and so were some blossoms! Bright orange / red buildings, and a few plum blossoms out made for quite a striking place to visit, but also the grounds were immaculate and a bit less rough compared to others I had visited so far. Itâ€™s not surprising why so many people visit this temple, and itâ€™s also a place I didnâ€™t mind seeing a lot of people - it felt appropriately lively ðŸ™‚.\n\nDinner was at the same place I ate from 2 nights ago, because I wanted to try the fried ginger pork. This was tasty again, though I think I preferred the katsu I had the first time! Still, was good to try a different meal, and this one had grilled onion and beansprouts which are always a winner!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1W7ptAAvD6JcX6jFGBIlIHPND2sRObsWU?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mPT9Ow_JZcdbdFIxi502_cWhtUz9R70G?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yOvlWUSwJu9a2JTouWjyFC5wOuC9ZORy?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_tzT3JCPFSHreeVRabZZCsXTDNAVyp1T?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1My3h6u3QYFTLtjo9nCwHYATDKnZNo5Fn?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gqfVYRpZM4zTE3HiUA4s271zynEIVOHN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lp_dFlS6uDaFfw986RMxuCeTtpROKQEB?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VWu6chfxxYhTLIOIPasKSquP6Wy5mxej?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13XyBGrclh0Ax0tCHy6x5-d_YD3qK17VI?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1l9ZDfix0m9Kb7m7dS6tUuS2pRytzbtKC?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GCk9qNuWf1eW6YEFEWhRUfubrFz1Ugj2?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1DSmrVcFJXktp4G1AVZyYobWJAkzpUIc6?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10GOB_e_KQ4xVfI0zuctlZqSAh7sBSJEn?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19Hx6e5S4OMdNuiaXr4WjUHc_S7u3-qe4?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VzMtz7hu8dj5Kpv9QFQRw_VOJDweR5uV?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R8rYL_5RTP71RS-iCX7W4e_s7BF-36nh?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vQVEozeR3L6Awv0eSwQ0Wci9gKjblrvx?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18hXiOic1NkLt22RAi0wjC-cSo_iJpadb?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XddrNK1XzP-HQG6QviQL3eSXObZ73XvG?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LF4fhkIh1tX-I55kaE7LPMDga8evl1jr?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vC1sHvv3RR4nsJqfMsc7m7o03wL1ZcE3?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SLJaTX3ht9ahXuaxZ4ros_W2EIt7OIDf?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WyYRzk9uZzKKPE1c_cJWykITh90VwmWf?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bqwVCB2XKLd6pFjo9E9dhmDxU3rPXtB2?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1nyQeZxaC1QAl6_-N2UwbG1dCu_OotuCD?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NMmpayTZQcgKbf2bm4f2UAdBCB9HqnKT?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1j3dJJ7Jj6r6iu-FtRqBxvwPDH-xbB-SU?authuser=0"}]}
