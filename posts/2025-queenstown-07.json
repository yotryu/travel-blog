    "title": "Final Day / Ice Bar",
    "content": "After a busy week, and this being the last full day of the holiday, everyone was pretty happy to chill out around town and take it easy. This meant half of us wandered the gardens near the house before meeting up with the rest around coffee time.\nThe gardens are very pleasant, and beautifully presented, with some manicured elements, and a lot of natural cared-for trees and displays. We took our time looking around, happy to have a slow but still very interesting walk. In particular some of the old redwoods they have are insane - the size and shape of them really is something else.\nThe walk put us on the edge of the town where a really nice cafe sits on the lake's shore, so this was our stop for coffee today! Once again we had a great coffee, this time accompanied by a nicely spiced 'Beatrix Potter Carrot Cake'. Sitting there, having a coffee and cake, chatting about the trip and taking in the view, I think we were all pretty content. The rest of the group met us while we were sitting, so the kids played on the nearby playground until we were about ready for lunch.\nWe had decided we'd have a nice pub lunch for the last day, so we walked to the wharf shops and picked our favourites! Another great meal to round out the week.\nThe rest of the day we mostly split up and did our own thing in smaller groups - shopping, organising luggage, relaxing.\nOne last thing for the trip though, was going to an Ice Bar! Two of us decided to give it a go before grabbing a light dinner, and we managed to just snag the last spots when we arrived. While it is a bit of a novelty, the experience of an Ice Bar is still very fun. Is basically a freezer box with ice walls and sculptures. Drinks were served in frozen ice 'glasses', and the 2 I had were very nice. With the music blasting and the general positive energy of all inside, this was a fun way to spend the last afternoon of the trip.\nWe grabbed some street food for a light dinner, then grabbed some take away for others back at the house.\nAnd with that the holiday was pretty much over!",
