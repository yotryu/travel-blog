This whole area is perched on a hill at the end of the main street through town, which gives it a nice secluded feel.\n\nThe main shrine to visit here was Toshogu, which is the resting place of Tokugawa Ieyasu. I went here because it was highly reviewed, but I still wasn’t really expecting to be as impressed by it as I was. The size of the complex is huge compared to other shrines I’ve been to, so it had more of everything, and the structures all had insane detail and effort put into them. And all of this was before I reached the “inner shrine” where Ieyasu rests. Getting to this involved climbing a decent number of stone stairs to reach the highest point of the shrine complex. This area was beautiful, even if it wasn’t the most extravagent part of the shrine - the natural environment around the area really added to the whole feel of the place!\n\nAfter really being blown away by Toshogu, the rest of the shrines and temples in the area were more typical - not unimpressive, just not to the same level as Toshogu haha.\n\nA walk back to the train station marked the end of my time in Nikko, but there was still time left in the day by the time I got back to Tokyo.\n\n(One more post follows for today!)","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QhJ60EZodnORzb_AO-TGIOmQsQHtDGZj?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SwJSSP0KAD53h66NdZmd33qwYh8-SWpm?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10q3LvcPzvplRKc-cTiMcl470Bb_Xfkk6?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ba1hTZ4LeA9Rz9BMU219V5j5QnY-c9je?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1m8F5DJhhm8chCLsxKIHm4A2LUxWojkAI?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TA8UQHx4uPJl7b_R-FDs62OZdQE0_KhG?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TGMChYvVaTO7dCOCq6NhsODnWXn26f-T?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eb2dDN_JSx38e4UiCaMezRjBfKn8IoIQ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wXrvoC66T93CLwlA7q-vs_BQuxKABj7v?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1N17fP2Mf5ZtWvuv3dhX22pKNyj4wep5g?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HP2tnLSTWJOLFBpClSmfKaW7QzSBq19v?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vuUxjUuwawka2JWkkf6QQKNHCFytfdE_?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jj25ZmoUOW5GCDc9NYu1V-7xqt6mdd5w?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1F7hbNAML6DmJ81MO1EevgvNDjDKv2034?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zm8sb_gOoOvHrwFLpL-v97-fsh96ivhy?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rApgwfmWJjLqvgXS2Ga5iGwQc6fazzYr?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t04YfPJZHKAWCOcVsf2Bo7KjmkYg3gBG?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oXvOM-NbFsLGWl2yVHNAn2H3PUw5fdsm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OCr4QRs3hHRqnbRf6pfQQEf5MeNSLq6Q?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1uig1fSvnJEMmxel3e8I9Z0XH6YupENFj?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tJYVuM3z4henwRPqxkKUJwdFt2udHdJq?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TRB96DwAJTk0tHJv14-Cir9ek9gN_Hui?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1xQ1BIBWQkd5d3uDEOi3S4jEw-43Jzn8x?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1dV_PO-JMqu6KfWYGR30e9uXb5bq26gpJ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/17crCcQDQgROdZUEAQeM8lGru9H0lBGiO?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mxcy-Qv5mANdA8TaLoMHBvl-rJxwHa2m?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CLP-xShGSZIrVFoGPLS2qvTn4l8GcHv7?authuser=0"}]}
