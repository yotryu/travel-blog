Odaiba has a huge entertainment and shopping area - heaps of small shops as well as name brand stuff, and plenty of arcades and skill testers! Trent and Jules had heaps of fun trying to win things from the skill testers. We also went through Madame Tussauds - unexpected but turned out to be heaps of fun! Some of the photos we got with the wax sculptures were cool, others were… inappropriate and hilarious! Definitely worth the visit. \n\nAnother unexpected gem in Odaiba was the Gundam event outside one of the shopping centres - anime played on the screens which interacted with the “life sized” Gundam figurine. This was really cool!We finished the day in Odaiba with a walk through the Venus Fort (Grand) mall - an entire floor is designed to look like an old style European town with shops down the sides of the street, and some really impressive features spread throughout! Also, the roof was made to look like you were outside, and it kinda worked!\n\nWe spent longer in Odaiba than planned, but in the end it was definitely worth it - so many different things to see and do that wouldn’t have happened otherwise (all of them great!).","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RhMkm3MuwYitpMeAfm6KPvX4TR1RVWcy?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GulQTkcSGyTvPT1MZnLvEq5HHYUkT4Dh?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZTJ_-izA_Yx5D8Nk-uttvCsjvU-Hx5QM?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1je_FfPkyjjVRW49pJqee8FiPJZp76773?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19VJ7iO24kFHUmNoKR_nt5Ey9np3K62gF?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iAYhmikqDZYvckuaaY-70FR1v9T-7pDA?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sjL7Yf1aNILsyVflchaFL2Le4MfBVDkW?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1lQyq0VycshhggrW2W49QU2-doqOLY3gy?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZbxYtDNkbIdgCN9e-sAdUc83Dkou_vGB?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1b2s6sviyn_KG8YnJCNJOq_B3IA4wUFZx?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/140-Ej0MKvhiGQGSww4li3U7vz7xb5Nkx?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KW8xeBorXHvlrnpYsBKNvAf5gxF2-mDM?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yEH0N5r-UzaQhsTnRM1XH8nW9NlhNaVJ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bclon4a-fTwGNL7UT2tSTGWGw1npEpjz?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KQBsvfFCKPwHt27t_wb0ag62RtjgWRL9?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1yg2FaxlURVhQXhNJg0MEJyEqqBQRZoem?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NiPzF-IF5Ec227jtXz1zvo5ukbqTW0Jt?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16O30nrrLxbYBxIBY0rglPgHuiKGwCXxW?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1-m-HP7Io_9Pml24zVDbds6cSdC_WtHMl?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mX5u_6VM9sYKwVk9b0DPfAmTpdmggrJ_?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1n9xXzUJabq99Nt4zwfxBe5hHS8WDRWQd?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Uab5sjwqnFZzNhPzI1LomYqWBYfd02Q7?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1BOG6s5utm51ryfKsUogii56D1jAQmQSZ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1zSXOo099HOvSfDJ0rJwZagtOKI8_Gsba?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UePaXompdiADgo9bFGH-Nwjkd6iJn3I5?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JAAbTB-nsxJGwo9LhYoflBVv0RODvYJK?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1I7crlJlfq10uVNGux6aExMwwnmeBPEIJ?authuser=0"}]}
