    "content": "This morning was a little earlier than we had been so we could get ourselves geared up to go to Coronet Peak! Unfortunately the weather was quite cloudy, but at least no rain.\nThe bus was nice and smooth, and the kids were getting very excited about all the snow on the side of the road as we got higher up - this was fun to see and hear.\nOnce we arrived, it was coffee time! So today's was on the mountain, and unexpectedly great (mountain food is usually not amazing, so this was a very nice surprise).\nWith some snacks had, we were ready for the snow. We started with some snow play and photos, then everyone tried some sledding. The kids ended up having a great time after some initial nervousness - definitely not a bad activity when the weather was the way it was.\nNext up we all rode the gondola to the top station, where thankfully the peak was above the clouds - this made for a really spectacular view! The bed of clouds below, sun in the blue sky above, and mountains peaking through the clouds all around in the distance. We snagged some group photos, then made our way up the walk to the peak - this was a little more hairy than I remembered, but everyone made it up safely.\nAfter some admiring and photos, we made our way back down for lunch at the main building. Nothing fancy, but nice enough.\nThe afternoon was more sledding for the kids, now full of confidence and 'racing' each other, having heaps of fun.\nA short bus ride back down and the day was wrapped up, with everyone happy to relax back at the house for another quiet evening after another excellent day!",
