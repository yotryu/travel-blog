The secret areas, tricks, and hidden mechanisms were all really cool to learn about and see.\n\nNext we wandered through the museum of equipment, garbs, and historical pieces. Learning about the reason for certain things being designed the way they were was really interesting - more than any other exhibition I think the practicality was on display here.\n\nFinally we watched a full-on demonstration of ninja weapon and combat skills. This was fantastic! Genuinely so much training and talent on display with all manner of equipment, each serving a different purpose which was shown. It really was a fun and impressive display!\n\nThe drive to lunch at the next rest stop was through some really nice countryside - more very small communities and farm lands.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1u4eqoamYqD-aE-LqZJNC29ZKqcxvmYtT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1au6dIsQoXTsdhUEo0o3GX8TBtF9So8v3?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/10yyKzn5l8jKOK55NLEvEgskbnoNn4sif?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/181g6zE0czPjIDlPv-rh1DmCmCKonkO8D?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1CjqM8R07x9bF6tI7I4XiUs8C4BWE4Qr-?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Xs3yU3tENFhBG1Hn8-k1fG6wbpQN5IPp?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tWNvN5Xuas5vtKF8j7-Yw6sKmTRYIySF?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1InESmoCCLQ2mCaS1H21e-rAswmu5pWL5?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/16Uki_D--us0ltVQXM6-QZIao4mDZ-ehv?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NmNmq-E90uq73puBlxeIPbL6xRksDKZj?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1B54Z-oOk0u_3khuXkidiQubx5N_r8CDC?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Dl0hRv21YKgk6NqOFemUdpn5ShQIlcZH?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1wjBF5M99pnYnMY6woJqE8g3YTC5Jrj8r?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/12CLbkL7uDA26Ury12SL4nSdFx5m1LEFg?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Au-kXJ9wVSoeChkvZSUP2nKsOwUpzJqK?authuser=0"}]}
