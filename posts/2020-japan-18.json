The town sits at the base of a temple complex that stretches up the mountain from the valley, and back down the other side to the town of Kibune.\n\nThe stream of buildings and smaller structures along the path were pretty impressive, mostly for the number of them, and their location up the zigzagging mountain trail.\n\nThankfully the hike was a little easier compared to others I have done so far! It was still a lengthy hike, taking an hour and a half from valley to valley, but there were some good views along the way. I even got a good view of a helicopter carrying away cut down trees from the side of a mountain across the valley!\n\nArriving in Kibune, straight away there was a neat mid-sized shrine that looked nice and tidy, and had a number of gates lining the short path to it. With the surrounding mountainside forest, it made for a very nice end to the hike.\n\nNext I walked through the village to reach an underwhelming shrine at the top. What wasn’t underwhelming though, was the town itself - some really beautiful old buildings with some of the best facade / entrances I’ve seen so far. Even better was the river running behind one side’s buildings - this river was flowing well and was setup in a way that there were frequently drops and rocks making it look great, but even more impressive is the thought that during summer the restaurants along the river put floors and rooves over it and serve customers lunch and dinner in the cool! Having seen the area, I can imagine how fantastic of an experience that would be!\n\nThe rest of the day is in the next post!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eJ3R1ku0K3V9E1HUdagDHyGBq_Jv73nN?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rQ8atB6K1OoMcTn35ojVD7QVlfA_65PS?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NzqBYETnnKKZye1MPkU08bAtoNj1ThvW?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ubfz-njONWunDcgnTnPNu1lf3cmm_Oe_?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Myx8f6s4xCdUiJrb-We7nscEXDDlTAyv?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1bD7nHPdeKhRWmN3bOLbHCGlPrX4VdIQm?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11PhMaSrjgOZVdLTiAvBYKlxz5CWONsS6?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/19GC-Q1z-Cw68ZR5nSE7xFh4-gn8hDVE1?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mcS4qZXOI7R_Y4tetOBOmug9vE8V6iBG?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GzndR0iE0CSiSSwA1G0EMnbkLjizYhVL?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hCpOqMZZTAEFSAc5LbBbW-3soWj2rQTa?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SMPOEEUUx5gFjtsG4h3ydt-gV-4D5qZq?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZmUKgHMGmF-E1X0V4eorGIyKjp9lB5fC?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1VcUlr61S_A-4XQQpNr_xB-J0HkTxrsQy?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cvP-M1FBRewqgunsmsBmCyrGkldA7pRa?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SghwTrQ8qgiN7u6EcDGt5-OOQ3VTaHSt?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Znv7zAG6HcOvdrbbS6UV9Jlj6X4MfoK_?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11Smu9m2v4_DBb98zQgng03UcgAYMgYZQ?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18xl3_OBvJPjkDtIwSyrI0Q-_QKy0_0Z8?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1N2Q09WAmQkuac3zp35fJpB1xfdeYgAZm?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pIEaG5crueT5yHND6Mp3DcS16Py3n3q3?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1iE9Tdibn7x7icXMAIqLUeHds2moU7hPT?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SRSuCjaB78PV3ohfk9OA3WQu9X-ESN2M?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rBrqe54cBxRK744_DgWbaR4yzJBbgAMN?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1OiOuVayNfcIcA4N9LZcoqDeAgldR83uY?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1R4ikHef7HEEbcyBa-NFvJEHEFZQPJ4bi?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/155qLqyh-X5hz59eoERCa-x-hjLvn2WE_?authuser=0"}]}
