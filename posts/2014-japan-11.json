{"id":"2014-japan-11","collection":"2014-japan","date":"2014 February 3","title":"Tokyo -> Kyoto - Bamboo Grove","content":"This morning we were up “early” to catch the Shinkansen to Kyoto. We were all pretty keen to get going and experience how they work - the others were pretty impressed. As expected it was a nice and smooth journey that took about 2.5 hours.\n\nAfter lunch we went for a short walk to a temple near the central Kyoto station - there were renovations happening, but that didn’t stop us from experiencing the impact of the place. Many people were entering the main temple building (which was huge) and praying. Watching them carry out their ritual still impresses - ordinary people who make the time to kneel on the floor of a temple and pray, even in the middle of a city. It really is an interesting thing to see.\n\nNext we decided to trip out to Arashiyama to check out some slower paced scenery and the Bamboo Forest ( / Grove). It was nice to see a smaller township (on the outskirts of Kyoto) for a change, but the big thing was the Bamboo Grove - this walk was truly impressive. Before you enter the grove there is a wall of cool, clean, fresh air, then the grove itself is amazing to see. Surrounded by tons of tall bamboo, pretty much no outside sound (except for the occasional train), and there was even a shrine in the middle - this place really was something else.\n\nWe made it back in to Kyoto for dinner and an early night back to the room - Kyoto is a big change from the hustle and bustle of Tokyo at night, so we can finally catch up on some sleep!","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1sPfNCUYngxuiDoXWqqY9CHRfACsTwWxe?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1cAsK3r0B6kpl38RGVp2Y8BTVX-__YXnP?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1WtUicOmugvkFpbbF1kq3-tsx-e6SVVxF?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EjgZPvTCwiO26JipOZHm1cxStwdTE9YZ?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1w2202qUtBUtWMubhuVY3XRqjVLNGjlUA?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eEdXaRDACNtXgvNbhkfenaHI3KPvSDVS?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18NbgnCk3pBgwdy33r-qyKGCQr2nHFc0M?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ebAnmhM0MRgGWBKvrE7n3A4CMiAqXmje?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1r2wQX-k_OnvRhOr4ef7H5kYFwVH5EH3O?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1YVmYoPKMSpXO9-xjRXfC1kqIzAI7foVo?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1oV7QB_7ecHegcdbGZj24IR3hQEpHzJxI?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vnUZO9l1QMjyWZpfUukrRs2UHcbIyyf0?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1_h7Yag-QBKE2TE9rpYgwgLCI9zRpRzDf?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1HWHfqSgMZIOHOpbY0ht7Kvg7lmIR4dc9?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mEPN53l_-apgXHyMXxSZnHFMrGaYqveU?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1X9cwC3yD0jcr_-KGZtMEw10keQbKtI2B?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SZqPXkgr-GmTkWBM6X97ztRSPgsTrP-s?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1abV-hsW3fDA5jlhF4Uu9c931YXuUrGpM?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Fvm4g9Q7vZePZqpMAFkKizEggzzeAcll?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1H6YrCCMO7xR2PDeK4rMJDcFJKFY59JyA?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Y_eJSogEyN0IMH6kgxga62ASSAnVckXl?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1M7zSBaod4FHb6buz3ZSu6py7vP1C7rmG?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1rveaq4TwL2diy4otYWWe7v7uRcI6O_MI?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LWipVSzhjBO7Lk2FKzXhdVtYLPNLMtmj?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/156HvuFtwOIY3h21CV1apN5_qNxRNhh7m?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1SVru7hyBtLjptwBJXe_ho9dDHFaT74gs?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1LHYXxwgy086jA-kHdtUH5iYzpjMNpAep?authuser=0"}]}
