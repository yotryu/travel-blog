Given my lack of luck with seeing Fuji in the past, I was glad to see it so clearly this trip!\n\nThe bus dropped us at the park, we sorted our tickets, then just had to wait a few minutes until the park opened.\n\nAs soon as we were in, the queuing began! We managed to ride 7 times, across the 4 main rollercoasters: Do-dodonpa, Fujiyama, Eejanaika, Takabisha.\n\nDo-dodonpa accelerates for 0-180km/h in 1.56s, and has an enormous loop in the middle.\n\nFujiyama has a 79m height for the initial lift and drop, and is very long.\n\nEejanaika “inverts” the rider the most times of any coaster in the world (along with loops and corks, the seats actually flip as part of the ride as well!)\n\nTakabisha has a 121 degree drop that it eases you into.\n\nWe enjoyed all of them (though I was admittedly nervous for most the first time), but my favourite was easily Eejanaika - the chaos and smoothness combined to almost immediately replace the nervousness with exhilaration and just great fun!\n\nIn the end we managed a pretty good day, and I think we both enjoyed it a lot! After the rides started closing, we parted ways and I caught a train to Kawaguchiko to stay the night.\n\nDinner was delicious teppanyaki from a very small local place (3 tables).","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MwtorAlMpiJ4RFbmBJHmys8G_zeLZ3vc?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Efj6BG5PVdDBG_j_fGCsburd1tnHUGOU?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1kRcXcfTJDQ9p4z3RixEZXYQhj4k89gAX?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15I1DmPs5XmLSUUD-ym5Kjh9lf9akRIQ6?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZbUUxoOJAxT2ZM0eQkCz2FszBlWkdfhd?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1a3hG4Jqc-xKq7N9lg9ZKeT53rgI7vaiP?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RWjJZIb2tPto1t53QUR6BCvSqw60t3m-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1hYm68Wf-Vg4lhtJKp02BR3RMK7X24oDJ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1t_NTFhDMpLe6HqyljtNK08mmqvc8UrPP?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1QOXELBAfkmAGxK8IWzuAciynUAjUwc3-?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Kfs4Pf4UvBaGDNm5QThz8dIMPpLeAO11?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18B01Kmj4-9Xvxv5KnSjYB5PqWW_8ksrS?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1eU8jL2HQX99FmEF0Y0WHziyFqOUj6UF_?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1pH6_j-J7Vg_MMNjozAwJqWKGB2ydZA4b?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1UQahXw-XnWDXjO4jnYRMp7d-AONUatOc?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1EbFokN5AWvbs28_gHDWrTw_iil0nnfLq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MWZHnzFcSl001bXw4RtyEo8FqdrpPrqY?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TwP_5Tlur_N2EBpnXr_OmjIpdIpwkrSg?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1vNMoAAWJ0j94Cb1QA2lDe934NVsWKI1H?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1mqz4KaawWUO5gJbUiio4pvmoszXo8d66?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1KwZzsUIkzqtL-5D_RxkF-bvVmrQbY5BA?authuser=0"}]}
