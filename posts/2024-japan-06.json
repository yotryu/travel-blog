{"id":"2024-japan-06","collection":"2024-japan","date":"2024 December 1","title":"Kyoto - Fushimi Inari + Night Walk","content":"Still plenty of the day left!\n\nWe arrived in Kyoto / Fushimi Inari mid-afternoon and had a reasonable amount of time to explore and take in the lower shrine (no hiking up the mountain for us). It's still as impressive and interesting as ever, though (understandably) very busy. The endless torii winding around the mountainside, surrounded by some truly beautiful scenery makes it such a unique place.\n\nThe autumn colours were starting to make a more vibrant appearance here too, which added to the feel of the place.\n\nFor the evening / night, our tour guide offered to give a walking tour of a stretch of the city not too far away (by subway). I was the only one from our group to join this, but I had a great time. Got to know some more of the tour group and saw some properly interesting buildings all lit up. In particular when I reached one of the temple grounds at the end of the road - there were food stalls around the entrance, and the area was lit in a way that showed off the structures and trees really well. I had dinner from one of the stalls (an okonomiyaki-like doughy thing) which was awesome, and I just enjoyed spending some time there.","images":[{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1gcGormZBLQo6pXy0E--jPTz3fofdRBBw?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TZ-aWAkXiF6Yo3aHJ338Tyw6p-P75F4E?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Nrceaexp_u9VhKKabHKbFl8_RO4UvPs7?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1l6L6FV8uQuJXKk2sOIg8QXBW3Lb9RO57?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/15S6SjFpePRAsYn2W-IGP2wDzSYqK7YiZ?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aFIqgO1F-nV1RN6kLF0-1iMMo_Tg0n3H?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1go0kPYe3Divv6DTNxgC74JdtNdfLaute?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1tkAI9gZcafg0dO1Z2EVbtqrKuHh-_SFO?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1M-V-VJSiLCMOvf5K-jR-Nrw8nO72rqNb?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1jtJeColChgMFC3Row-jKmL10_pu0NIOl?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1MbFKc8R_F712TcnoaLSbMPtZ5kzkK3uk?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1u93RL7UTlBp6reDhwseA4Ge5n45TH6j0?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1NlZU79LJPDZMc1GwFTz6vYAy8xQ9rKh7?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1TlfCU0txb2js1sOfr99hr2ep8w8Mc5pD?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18wsmpiEM57g-VCTE-wMY73M3yTtWWpvd?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1okuIb735dHNn3CkGVpqyjerqXgWGD2QF?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1GATy4tZS9U5LX6u3KVG8qG2Hx-DQBOuX?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1JatVVWCG75z2IX-7KTCc8aiXkmTYv_Z7?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1V-DP-rpgBHCwiV2gA8BfegCZxhhaclt2?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1aZ14Kw_GNDMGL_KfgRoO0kWg7GRmvJEE?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1RQJluHHTSPxli0GoHpAwW6svdd5OlUXn?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/11ASr1doR4n9yfPlRxJLaketsTB6NahMq?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1Derf2IMo4pDqc1CaXqLWgZllDJDvR3KW?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/13-DKZBwJWKhTpK_wnINdmaxwNnCK1b9M?authuser=0"},{"src":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1ZK-coXFDdJm7E1odO7L5GCJ-psANPC9S?authuser=0","collageSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/1XolyOo_rpYmBDYOOo63QRuiGrQ4zS65S?authuser=0","navSrc":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d/18XdsptD3P__MLJ_ctqcBndVmjMG0wRqX?authuser=0"}]}
